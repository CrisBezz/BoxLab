# BoxLab Development Roadmap

This is the persistent product roadmap for BoxLab.

The repository is the source of truth. Keep this file aligned with `AI_HANDOFF.md`, `DEV_HISTORY.md`, and `TEST_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Product direction

BoxLab is an **iPad-first touch/Pencil polygon modeller and Nomad Sculpt companion**.

Core principle:

**Import → Clean → Model → Export → Nomad Sculpt**

BoxLab should stay fast, direct, topology-aware and shallow. It should not become Blender-on-iPad.

## Phase A — Topology intelligence / Clean for SubD

**Status: COMPLETE at v0.36.18.323.**

Delivered:
- conservative four-triangle fan repair
- sliver/skinny-triangle cleanup
- bounded even triangle-island complete matching up to 40 connected triangles
- complete matching only; no stranded triangle forcing
- surrounding quad-flow quality
- whole-patch boundary guards
- internal proposed-quad flow coherence
- average + worst-local internal-flow ranking
- smooth-interior valence regularity
- average + worst-local valence ranking
- conservative residual triangle-pair merge
- guarded all-quad tangent relaxation
- topology audit for invalid references, repeated/collapsed edges, duplicate faces, non-manifold edges and orphan crease data
- transactional rollback in the core cleanup pipeline
- generated irregular-mesh regression fixtures
- UI-level topology validation remains as a second line of defence

Phase A freeze rule:
- v0.36.18.339 reopened Phase A only for a concrete Clean shape-preservation regression; sharp incident normal breaks are now protected during relaxation
- do not resume blind triangle-cap growth
- do not chase exotic remeshing research without a concrete user-facing failure
- future Clean for SubD changes require a real modelling case or a reproducible regression

## Phase B — Precision modelling

**Status: planned precision slice complete through v0.36.18.340.**

Priority candidates:
- cross-object snapping — **Add Vertex in v0.36.18.324; component Move snapping added in v0.36.18.325**
- precision drag/readback polish — **live component Move ΔX/ΔY/ΔZ readback added in v0.36.18.326**
- Repeat Previous audit/polish for exact repeated operations — **Repeat Extrude / Repeat Inset pre-existed .327; redundant duplicate loader removed in v0.36.18.328**
- Align / Flatten component tools — **existing Make Planar retained; Align X/Y/Z added in .329 and upgraded to explicit pick-anchor workflow in v0.36.18.330**
- Circle / regularize selected components where topology permits — **simple closed Vertex/Edge loop Circle added in .331; single selected Face boundary support added in .333; UI moved from Selection to contextual Active Tools in .334; exact Vertex/Edge/Face Active Tools slots arranged in v0.36.18.336**
- Edge Split canonical-Multi regression — **fixed in v0.36.18.335 by making Edge paint selection yield while Face Split is armed**
- Edge Flip for manual topology-flow correction — **existing Rotate Edge audited as the same triangle-pair diagonal swap; consolidated under the clearer Flip Edge label in v0.36.18.337**
- stronger structured Fill / Grid Fill / Cap workflows — **existing Fill is the current single-face Cap; conservative four-sided all-quad Grid Fill added in v0.36.18.338**
- support-loop construction improvements — **existing Offset Loop audited as the support-loop tool; transactional validation, canonical rail selection and Multi-safe Pencil handoff added in v0.36.18.340**
- **Edge Extrude** — **direct boundary/loose-edge ribbon workflow added in v0.36.18.423; repeated pulls automatically continue from the newly created outer rail; v0.36.18.425 adds Free/X/Y/Z/Auto directional constraints projected perpendicular to the source edge; v0.36.18.426 adds free Plane-constrained pulling perpendicular to the grabbed edge; v0.36.18.427 keeps the tool/constraint armed while tapping or switching boundary-edge selection**
- preserve direct Pencil interaction and minimal mode switching

## Phase C — Object / instance workflow

**Active phase.**

- linked-instance editing robustness — **explicit Linked Duplicate + shared-source manager foundation added in v0.36.18.343; ordinary Duplicate remains independent** — **v0.36.18.362 hardens the shared-geometry / independent-placement contract across activation and modelling edits**; **v0.36.18.363 makes linked-copy creation atomic so second-generation links are born attached before activation** — **v0.36.18.366 makes the live mesh bridge authoritative before every render so linked edits commit the visible mesh**
- Make Unique audit/polish — **explicit Make Unique detach path added in v0.36.18.343; continue robustness testing/polish**
- cross-object reference/edit workflows — **Reference imports already served as snap targets; v0.36.18.344 hardens them as permanently read-only modelling guides across single/Multi/Group/history paths**
- stronger multi-object editing — **audit confirmed Multi Move / Scale / Rotate / numeric transforms / grouping / Duplicate / Join / Boolean already existed; Multi Linked Duplicate + Multi Make Unique parity added in v0.36.18.346**
- Join/Boolean workflow polish — **v0.36.18.347 consolidates both workflows onto the authoritative Object scene-history bridge; legacy parallel Boolean Undo/Redo wrapper removed while A/B UX, hidden originals, unique results, linked-instance metadata and Reference exclusions are preserved**
- persistent object/region organization — **v0.36.18.348 makes Group metadata persistent; v0.36.18.349 makes Groups first-class; v0.36.18.350 compacts the tree; v0.36.18.351 centralizes Group ownership; v0.36.18.352 restores two-object viewport feedback + compact naming; v0.36.18.353 fixes focused Rename/live header refresh; v0.36.18.354 adds whole-Group visual context; v0.36.18.355 fixes grouped transform routing; v0.36.18.356 compacts Object/Group rows; v0.36.18.357–.358 harden upward More popovers; v0.36.18.359 restores per-object Delete and adds keyboard Delete/Backspace.; v0.36.18.360 makes Origin/Pivot contextual and compacts the Object Selection toolbar.; v0.36.18.361 adds direct per-object SubD Preview toggles to compact Outliner rows.**

- Group Boolean convenience — **v0.36.18.368–.369:** two complete Groups can act as Boolean A/B operands; .369 replaces the naive disconnected Join operand with a shell-by-shell compound Boolean path, while source Groups remain intact/hidden for Undo.

### Beta 3 release-candidate hardening

**v0.36.18.371** is the approved **frozen Beta 3** checkpoint. The user completed the hands-on release gate on 2026-09-20 and the exact approved release tree is published under `/beta-3/`. Phase D may now resume on live `main` while Beta 3 remains immutable except for an explicitly approved emergency release fix.

### Beta 4 release checkpoint

**v0.36.18.427** is the Beta 4 checkpoint, frozen from main commit `ec45b3ba208ef3ffa40015d7a3b62666c63f379e` under `/beta-4/`. It captures the Phase D Tool Session consolidation plus the direct Edge Extrude ribbon workflow through Plane constraints and live edge-selection handoff. Normal development continues on live `main`; Beta 4 remains immutable except for an explicitly approved emergency fix.

## Phase D — Construction tools
- surface-relative Transform / Insert workflow — **Transform Tool foundation added in v0.36.18.436: target-face placement, Move/Rotate/Scale surface frame, tap-to-cycle interaction; intended shared engine for future linked-instance Insert Tool**


Only add focused tools that suit BoxLab:
- topology-aware Symmetry / Bisect / Apply — **origin-plane X/Y/Z foundation with Keep +/- and optional welded Mirror added in v0.36.18.428; movable X/Y/Z plane with Vertex/Edge/Midpoint/Face geometry snapping added in v0.36.18.433; arbitrary-plane rotation and transform ownership added in v0.36.18.434; Align to Face + Flip Plane added in v0.36.18.435**
- Shell / Solidify
- Array
- Sweep where appropriate — **Sweep Path foundation added in v0.36.18.393; v0.36.18.394 added reliable Apply redraw + true 3D Geometry Snap; v0.36.18.395 changes Sweep to a profile-first workflow with a movable Profile Plane, Circle/Rectangle/custom profiles, editable construction state, and dual path sources: SketchUp-style Follow Edges or free Draw Path; v0.36.18.396 refines custom Draw with a compact Profile Plane and explicit Open/Closed profiles, including open-profile surface Sweep preview; v0.36.18.397 fixes profile closure/orientation mirroring; v0.36.18.398 hardens concave closed profiles and exact start-ring placement; v0.36.18.399 corrects side-face normals; v0.36.18.400 fixes Sweep edit ownership/transform disarm; v0.36.18.401 adds Use Selection for a preselected Face or closed Edge loop; v0.36.18.402 adds direct Face/Edge selection launch; v0.36.18.403 fixes closed-profile node insertion; v0.36.18.404 anchors selected profiles directly to the first rail edge; v0.36.18.405 unifies closed-shell normals; v0.36.18.406 moves Sweep into the new exclusive Tool Session UI with PROFILE / PATH / FINISH stages**
- Lathe where appropriate
- lightweight deformers only if they fit direct touch modelling

## Phase E — Import / repair / handoff

- Mesh Health / Inspect workflow
- Auto Close / Make Watertight
- stronger boundary diagnostics
- normals / triangulation controls
- export polish
- GLB export if useful for the Nomad/3D handoff workflow

## Phase F — iPad UX polish

- browser-selection interaction guard — **native Safari selection/callout suppressed across BoxLab UI while editable fields remain exempt in v0.36.18.345**
- **Solidify/Shell migrated in .421; Revolve Profile migrated in .422**
- persistent tool modes
- left-hand access
- reduced tap count — **v0.36.18.406 makes Face/Edge → Sweep jump directly to PATH/Follow Edges and removes the need to hunt through Object Active Tools**
- consistent Pencil drag behaviour
- selection-region workflow
- numerical precision entry/readback
- landscape-first layout
- selection visibility at all zoom levels

## Protected product behaviour

Preserve:
- one-finger orbit
- two-finger pan
- pinch zoom
- two-finger tap Undo
- three-finger tap Redo
- no-jump orbit pivot
- persistent selections during navigation
- Studio realtime default/behaviour
- object management / Multi
- current snapping
- mature Through behaviour
- existing core modelling tools
- transactional topology operations

## Deferred / intentionally not active

- path tracing: abandoned in favour of Studio realtime
- broad sculpting / voxel remesh: belongs in Nomad rather than BoxLab
- Blender-scale scene-management complexity
- speculative topology work without a user-facing failure
