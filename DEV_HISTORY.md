# BoxLab Development History

This is the concise append-only development log used for cross-chat continuity.

Do not record every tiny cache-busting or temporary deployment workflow commit. Record meaningful modelling, architecture, UI, stability, and release milestones.

Newest entries should be added at the top.

## 2026-09-19 — v0.36.18.322 worst-local internal-flow ranking

- Released **v0.36.18.322** from PR #6; squash merge commit: `0f03befbb7d69ca53194536579c240a993efd9ff`.
- Clean for SubD internal proposed-quad flow ranking now combines average mismatch with a small worst-local mismatch term.
- New helper `quadInternalFlowPenalty(flows)` separates the acceptance penalty from the ranking-only worst-local term.
- Equal-average alternatives now prefer the patch that avoids concentrating flow mismatch into one badly aligned internal quad junction.
- The new worst-local term is ranking-only: the .321 acceptance score, quality thresholds, and 40-triangle solver envelope are unchanged.
- Regression workflow run **35404138276** completed successfully before merge.

## 2026-09-19 — v0.36.18.321 worst-local valence-aware patch ranking

- Released **v0.36.18.321** from PR #5; squash merge commit: `0b838da0cd2a31cd4d88c2390a9e15e9b0c58905`.
- Clean for SubD valence ranking now combines average smooth-interior valence error with a small worst-local error term.
- New helper `quadValencePenalty(errors)` makes the ranking behavior explicit and regression-testable.
- Equal-average alternatives now prefer the patch that avoids concentrating error into a more extreme extraordinary vertex.
- The new worst-local term is ranking-only; the .320 acceptance/quality gates and 40-triangle solver envelope are unchanged.
- Regression workflow for PR #5 passed successfully before merge.

## 2026-09-19 — v0.36.18.320 interior valence-aware patch ranking

- Released **v0.36.18.320** from PR #4; squash merge commit: `40e119774f39373ffadab22d0782428e8be7ea2c`.
- Clean for SubD complete-patch ranking now includes smooth-interior vertex valence regularity after the existing shape, surrounding-flow, and internal-flow terms.
- The new helper is `quadPatchValenceContext(mesh,pairs)` with `PATCH_VALENCE_WEIGHT=.25`.
- Ranking prefers safe complete matchings that leave eligible smooth interior vertices closer to quad valence 4 after paired triangle diagonals are removed.
- Boundary vertices and vertices touching creases are excluded from valence scoring.
- Valence is ranking-only: the existing .319 quality score still controls acceptance, so the 40-triangle envelope and prior quality/eligibility guards remain unchanged.
- Added regression coverage for valence-4 preference and crease-ring exclusion; Topology regression run **35401945842** completed successfully on the corrected PR head.

## 2026-09-19 — .319 handoff audit / repo reconciliation

- Re-audited current `main` against `AI_WORKFLOW.md` before closing the development chat.
- Confirmed **v0.36.18.319** is the released/live baseline: internal proposed-quad flow coherence is present, the bounded triangle-island envelope remains 40 triangles, and the .319 release/verifier had already completed successfully.
- Canonical .319 release commit remains `68e45845f6696b3e66929ee4b181748b85d99b09`; final clean Pages marker commit remains `4ed534dfe8697e54921a8a80d7b50945b6792342`.
- After the handoff files were first introduced, three later .319 commits (`51117f59...`, `a91ac689...`, `a0a2d072...`) re-exposed/cache-hopped/tested the same .319 internal-flow state. They do **not** represent a newer numbered release.
- Current code-bearing HEAD at this audit is `a0a2d072acbf2e397ca68e2276fd75c8a1643846`.
- Only permanent workflow currently present under `.github/workflows` is `through-regression.yml`; temporary .319 release/verifier workflows are removed.

## 2026-09-19 — Repository handoff system established

- Added `AI_WORKFLOW.md`, `AI_HANDOFF.md`, `DEV_HISTORY.md`, and `TEST_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Future AI development sessions must treat the repository as source of truth.
- Future sessions must update the living handoff and append meaningful history before finishing code-changing work.
- Initial handoff was audited from current `main`, not reconstructed from an older chat version.

## v0.36.18.319 — Internal proposed-quad flow coherence

- Clean for SubD patch scoring now considers flow coherence inside the proposed quad patch in addition to surrounding boundary context.
- Bounded triangle-island solving remains conservative and quality-gated.
- User-facing Clean for SubD wrapper retains topology validation and rollback.
- Release commit: `68e45845f6696b3e66929ee4b181748b85d99b09`.
- Audited post-release HEAD: `4ed534dfe8697e54921a8a80d7b50945b6792342`.

## v0.36.18.318 — Forty-triangle bounded local retopo

- Extended bounded local triangle-island retopology envelope to 40 triangles.
- Kept conservative patch quality guards and regression tests.

## v0.36.18.317 — Thirty-eight-triangle bounded local retopo

- Extended bounded local triangle-island retopology envelope to 38 triangles.

## v0.36.18.316 — Thirty-six-triangle bounded local retopo

- Extended bounded local triangle-island retopology envelope to 36 triangles.

## v0.36.18.315 — Thirty-four-triangle bounded local retopo

- Extended bounded local triangle-island retopology envelope to 34 triangles.

## Earlier protected baseline retained

The current repository has evolved through many earlier releases. Important protected behaviours that remain relevant include:

- iPad navigation gesture model
- persistent selections during navigation
- Studio realtime workflow
- object management / Multi
- Knife / Loop Cut / Bevel / Extrude / Inset
- connected multi-face Extrude
- cavity-aware Through
- Extract
- Bridge
- Join
- Boolean workflows
- Base/SubD export
- protected `src/multi-object-transform.js?v=0.36.1.0`
- intentionally pinned selection/UI stylesheet baseline where still referenced by current `index.html`

For exact implementation state, always inspect current `main`; this history is context, not authority.
