## .1034 — native colour alpha OFF shader correction — 31 October 2026

Current runtime target: 0.36.18.1034. Parent .1033 user PASS is protected,
including standalone PBR maps, seven-object import and VIEW stability.

Audit found the precise alpha-OFF defect in the existing native UV surface owner:
the RGB-only map shader hook was installed only when opacityMode() ran. A native
colour texture with use_color_opacity=false and no separate opacity map therefore
fell through to Three's default diffuseColor *= sampledDiffuseColor, multiplying
the constant cyan RGB by the image's checker alpha and producing black squares.
The original owner now installs the RGB-only shader hook for every supported lit
native colour surface with colour alpha OFF. opacityMode reuses the same hook when
a separate opacity map/factor also controls transparency. Explicit colour alpha ON
keeps Three's original RGBA sampling path; opacity, depth-write, shadow and source
byte behaviour are otherwise unchanged. No decoder rewrite or image re-encoding.

New actual-owner tests cover alpha OFF without a separate opacity map and explicit
alpha ON retaining RGBA. In-app TEST LIST adds the original comparison file:
docs/samples/NOM_COLOUR_ALPHA_1029.nom (left alpha ON, middle combined opacity,
right alpha OFF). Existing seven-object and standalone-map samples remain unchanged.
Displacement remains inspection/retention only.

Validation/publication status: source/test changes committed to main; local suite
not available in this connected session. Hosted CI and Pages/live byte verification
are pending and must be checked before calling this build fully released.
Native iPad/GPU appearance acceptance is pending.

DEVICE1034: import NOM_COLOUR_ALPHA_1029.nom in Studio and Solid. Right cube must be
solid cyan with no checker/black squares; left cube retains checker transparency;
middle retains combined colour-alpha plus separate opacity. Switch VIEW modes,
orbit, select/Move/UndoRedo, and verify prior .1033 standalone-map sample still works.
Next: confirm .1034 alpha behaviour, then separately benchmark displacement/subdivision
before implementation. Do not fold displacement into this shader correction.
