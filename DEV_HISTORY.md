# BoxLab Development History

This is the concise append-only development log used for cross-chat continuity.

Do not record every tiny cache-busting or temporary deployment workflow commit. Record meaningful modelling, architecture, UI, stability, and release milestones.

Newest entries should be added at the top.

## 2026-09-19 — .319 handoff audit / repo reconciliation

- Re-audited current `main` against `AI_WORKFLOW.md` before closing the development chat.
- Confirmed **v0.36.18.319** is the released/live baseline: internal proposed-quad flow coherence is present, the bounded triangle-island envelope remains 40 triangles, and the .319 release/verifier had already completed successfully.
- Canonical .319 release commit remains `68e45845f6696b3e66929ee4b181748b85d99b09`; final clean Pages marker commit remains `4ed534dfe8697e54921a8a80d7b50945b6792342`.
- After the handoff files were first introduced, three later .319 commits (`51117f59...`, `a91ac689...`, `a0a2d072...`) re-exposed/cache-hopped/tested the same .319 internal-flow state. They do **not** represent a newer numbered release.
- Current code-bearing HEAD at this audit is `a0a2d072acbf2e397ca68e2276fd75c8a1643846`.
- Only permanent workflow currently present under `.github/workflows` is `through-regression.yml`; temporary .319 release/verifier workflows are removed.

## 2026-09-19 — Repository handoff system established

- Added `AI_WORKFLOW.md`, `AI_HANDOFF.md`, `DEV_HISTORY.md`, and `TEST_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Future AI development sessions must treat the repository as source of truth.
- Future sessions must update the living handoff and append meaningful history before finishing code-changing work.
- Initial handoff was audited from current `main`, not reconstructed from an older chat version.

## v0.36.18.319 — Internal proposed-quad flow coherence

- Clean for SubD patch scoring now considers flow coherence inside the proposed quad patch in addition to surrounding boundary context.
- Bounded triangle-island solving remains conservative and quality-gated.
- User-facing Clean for SubD wrapper retains topology validation and rollback.
- Release commit: `68e45845f6696b3e66929ee4b181748b85d99b09`.
- Audited post-release HEAD: `4ed534dfe8697e54921a8a80d7b50945b6792342`.

## v0.36.18.318 — Forty-triangle bounded local retopo

- Extended bounded local triangle-island retopology envelope to 40 triangles.
- Kept conservative patch quality guards and regression tests.

## v0.36.18.317 — Thirty-eight-triangle bounded local retopo

- Extended bounded local triangle-island retopology envelope to 38 triangles.

## v0.36.18.316 — Thirty-six-triangle bounded local retopo

- Extended bounded local triangle-island retopology envelope to 36 triangles.

## v0.36.18.315 — Thirty-four-triangle bounded local retopo

- Extended bounded local triangle-island retopology envelope to 34 triangles.

## Earlier protected baseline retained

The current repository has evolved through many earlier releases. Important protected behaviours that remain relevant include:

- iPad navigation gesture model
- persistent selections during navigation
- Studio realtime workflow
- object management / Multi
- Knife / Loop Cut / Bevel / Extrude / Inset
- connected multi-face Extrude
- cavity-aware Through
- Extract
- Bridge
- Join
- Boolean workflows
- Base/SubD export
- protected `src/multi-object-transform.js?v=0.36.1.0`
- intentionally pinned selection/UI stylesheet baseline where still referenced by current `index.html`

For exact implementation state, always inspect current `main`; this history is context, not authority.
