# BoxLab Regression Test Checklist

This checklist is the persistent regression contract for BoxLab.

Run the sections relevant to a change. Expand this file when a new stable workflow becomes worth protecting.

## Core navigation

- [ ] one-finger orbit works
- [ ] two-finger pan works
- [ ] pinch zoom works
- [ ] two-finger tap Undo works
- [ ] three-finger tap Redo works
- [ ] orbit pivot does not jump
- [ ] navigation does not unexpectedly clear persistent selections

## Selection

- [ ] Vertex selection works
- [ ] Edge selection works
- [ ] Face selection works
- [ ] Face multi-select works immediately after a fresh app load, without requiring a mode change first
- [ ] returning to Face/Edge/Vertex from another selection mode restores intended additive component multi-selection
- [ ] Object selection works
- [ ] Visible / Through selection-depth controls work
- [ ] Loop selection works
- [ ] Ring selection works
- [ ] Boundary selection works

## Object / Multi

- [ ] object creation works
- [ ] switching active object works
- [ ] duplicate works
- [ ] rename works
- [ ] delete works
- [ ] Join works
- [ ] multi-object selection/management works
- [ ] object transforms do not regress
- [ ] reference objects remain protected from destructive editing

## Component alignment

- [ ] existing Make Planar remains available for a selected Face
- [ ] Align X enters anchor-pick mode, then aligns the other selected component vertices to the picked anchor X coordinate
- [ ] Align Y enters anchor-pick mode, then aligns the other selected component vertices to the picked anchor Y coordinate
- [ ] Align Z enters anchor-pick mode, then aligns the other selected component vertices to the picked anchor Z coordinate
- [ ] picked Align anchor stays fixed
- [ ] picked Align anchor gets the amber Boolean-style reference cue
- [ ] component Align preserves the current component selection
- [ ] component Align commits as one Undo step
- [ ] component Align is hidden in Object mode

## Precision snapping

- [ ] component Move displays live ΔX / ΔY / ΔZ while dragging
- [ ] snapped component Move keeps numeric delta readback visible alongside the snap target label
- [ ] Geometry-enabled component Move can snap selected vertices to visible geometry on other objects
- [ ] free component Move can align an edge/face/multi-component centre to another-object snap target
- [ ] axis-constrained component Move changes only the constrained coordinate when snapping cross-object
- [ ] target object remains unchanged during component Move snapping
- [ ] hidden/solo-excluded objects do not contribute component Move snap targets

## Vertex tools

- [ ] Add Vertex can snap to visible geometry on other objects without modifying the target object
- [ ] cross-object snapping prefers target vertices, then midpoints, then generic edge positions
- [ ] hidden/solo-excluded objects do not contribute snap targets

## Circle / regularize

- [ ] Circle appears in contextual Vertex / Edge / Face Active Tools, not in Selection
- [ ] Vertex Circle sits in the Slide / Create Face row as the third button
- [ ] Edge Circle sits immediately after Delete in the bottom Topology row
- [ ] Face Circle sits beside Poke Faces in the same row
- [ ] no old standalone bottom Circle row remains
- [ ] Circle is available for a simple closed selected Vertex/Edge loop or exactly one selected Face boundary
- [ ] Circle preserves the selected loop centre and working plane
- [ ] Circle regularizes existing loop vertices to one radius with even angular spacing
- [ ] Circle does not create or delete topology
- [ ] Circle preserves the current Vertex/Edge/Face selection
- [ ] Circle commits as one Undo step
- [ ] open chains / branched / ambiguous selections are refused

## Edge tools

- [ ] Grid Fill enables only for one simple planar convex four-sided boundary with matching opposite segment counts
- [ ] Grid Fill preserves all existing boundary vertices
- [ ] Grid Fill creates an all-quad U×V patch and selects the new faces
- [ ] Grid Fill is one Undo step and commits only after topology validation
- [ ] Grid Fill rejects irregular/curved boundaries, mismatched opposite counts, internal/non-boundary Edges and simple 4-edge caps
- [ ] Flip Edge is the single existing triangle-pair diagonal-swap tool (formerly Rotate Edge)
- [ ] Flip Edge enables only for one uncreased shared Edge between exactly two triangles
- [ ] Flip Edge selects the new diagonal after commit
- [ ] Flip Edge commits as one Undo step and rejects unsafe/inverted results
- [ ] Face Split works while canonical additive Multi selection remains enabled

## Face tools

- [ ] Precision Face / Repeat Previous UI appears only once
- [ ] drawer-ui is the single authoritative loader for Precision Face / Repeat Previous
- [ ] normal Extrude drag records an exact previous value for Repeat Previous
- [ ] normal Inset drag records an exact previous value for Repeat Previous
- [ ] Repeat Previous can be armed and applied by tapping another Face
- [ ] repeated Face operation uses the exact previously committed value
- [ ] Through / blocked / rollback Extrude gestures do not become Repeat Previous operations
- [ ] Extrude works
- [ ] connected multi-face Extrude works
- [ ] Inset works
- [ ] Knife works
- [ ] Extract works

## Through / topology-sensitive extrusion

- [ ] normal Through works
- [ ] Through into an existing cavity/tunnel works
- [ ] continuing through a cavity to a farther outer wall works
- [ ] multiple ordered Through targets work where supported

## Clean for SubD / Quad Clean

- [ ] Clean for SubD button is available in Object > Active Tools
- [ ] locked/reference objects cannot be destructively cleaned
- [ ] safe four-triangle fan repair works
- [ ] conservative sliver/skinny-triangle repair works
- [ ] bounded even triangle islands can be proposed up to the current 40-triangle envelope
- [ ] a safe 40-triangle strip can resolve to 20 quads
- [ ] a 42-triangle connected island remains outside the bounded complete-matching stage
- [ ] poor-quality patches are preserved rather than forced
- [ ] surrounding quad-flow context influences candidate quality
- [ ] internal proposed-quad flow coherence influences candidate quality
- [ ] coherent neighboring proposed quads score better than an equivalent zig-zag internal flow arrangement
- [ ] completed-patch ranking prefers smooth interior vertices closer to quad valence 4 when safe alternatives exist
- [ ] crease/boundary-protected vertices are excluded from valence regularity scoring
- [ ] equal-average valence alternatives prefer the patch with the lower worst local valence error
- [ ] equal-average internal-flow alternatives prefer the patch with the lower worst local flow mismatch
- [ ] topology audit accepts valid open-boundary meshes
- [ ] topology audit rejects duplicate/non-manifold/collapsed topology deterministically
- [ ] core Clean for SubD pipeline is transactional and restores the original mesh if a stage fails its topology audit
- [ ] generated irregular triangulated-strip fixtures remain topologically valid after cleanup
- [ ] safe remaining triangle pairs can merge to quads
- [ ] all-quad tangent relaxation remains guarded
- [ ] topology validation rejects/rolls back invalid results
- [ ] no-change result reports safely without corrupting the mesh
- [ ] Undo/Redo remains valid after a clean operation

## Boolean / extraction

- [ ] Boolean workflow works
- [ ] Boolean cleanup does not leave duplicate/degenerate faces
- [ ] Extract + Undo works

## Import / export

- [ ] Editable OBJ import works
- [ ] Editable GLB/GLTF import works where supported
- [ ] Reference import works
- [ ] Base OBJ export works
- [ ] multi-object Base OBJ export works
- [ ] SubD OBJ export works
- [ ] multi-object SubD OBJ export works

## History / transaction safety

- [ ] Undo works after the changed workflow
- [ ] Redo works after the changed workflow
- [ ] failed topology operations restore the pre-operation mesh
- [ ] object-manager state remains synchronized after geometry commits
- [ ] no partial mutation remains after a rejected operation

## UI / release integrity

- [ ] visible app version matches intended release
- [ ] module cache pins changed only where intended
- [ ] `styles.css?v=0.36.18.270` remains pinned unless deliberately changed
- [ ] `src/multi-object-transform.js?v=0.36.1.0` remains untouched unless deliberately changed
- [ ] `component-multi-init.js?v=0.36.18.314` remains present/pinned unless component-selection startup is deliberately changed
- [ ] drawer behaviour remains intact
- [ ] no service worker was introduced unintentionally
- [ ] GitHub Pages loads the intended build after release
