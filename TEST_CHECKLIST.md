# BoxLab Regression Test Checklist

This checklist is the persistent regression contract for BoxLab.

Run the sections relevant to a change. Expand this file when a new stable workflow becomes worth protecting.

## Core navigation

- [ ] one-finger orbit works
- [ ] two-finger pan works
- [ ] pinch zoom works
- [ ] two-finger tap Undo works
- [ ] three-finger tap Redo works
- [ ] orbit pivot does not jump
- [ ] navigation does not unexpectedly clear persistent selections

## Selection

- [ ] Vertex selection works
- [ ] Edge selection works
- [ ] Face selection works
- [ ] Face multi-select works immediately after a fresh app load, without requiring a mode change first
- [ ] returning to Face/Edge/Vertex from another selection mode restores intended additive component multi-selection
- [ ] Object selection works
- [ ] Visible / Through selection-depth controls work
- [ ] Loop selection works
- [ ] Ring selection works
- [ ] Boundary selection works
- [ ] Grow / Shrink / Connected selection works where applicable
- [ ] Angle / Normal selection works where applicable
- [ ] selection indicators remain usable while zooming
- [ ] navigation preserves the intended selection

## Object / Multi

- [ ] object creation works
- [ ] switching active object works
- [ ] duplicate works
- [ ] rename works
- [ ] delete works
- [ ] Join works
- [ ] multi-object selection/management works
- [ ] object transforms do not regress
- [ ] reference objects remain protected from destructive editing

## Vertex tools

- [ ] Add Vertex can snap to visible geometry on other objects without modifying the target object
- [ ] cross-object snapping prefers target vertices, then midpoints, then generic edge positions
- [ ] hidden/solo-excluded objects do not contribute snap targets
- [ ] Add Vertex works
- [ ] Build Edge works
- [ ] Vertex Slide works
- [ ] Vertex Bevel works
- [ ] multi-vertex bevel works where supported
- [ ] Vertex Join works
- [ ] Weld works
- [ ] Delete Vertex works safely

## Edge tools

- [ ] Loop Cut works
- [ ] Face Split works
- [ ] Edge Bevel works
- [ ] multi-edge bevel works where supported
- [ ] Crease works
- [ ] Uncrease works
- [ ] Edge Slide works
- [ ] Offset Loop works
- [ ] Edge Bridge works
- [ ] Fill works
- [ ] Dissolve Loop works
- [ ] Dissolve Edge works
- [ ] Delete Edge works safely

## Face tools

- [ ] Extrude works
- [ ] connected multi-face Extrude works
- [ ] Inset works
- [ ] Knife works
- [ ] Extract works
- [ ] Face Bridge works
- [ ] Delete Face works safely

## Through / topology-sensitive extrusion

- [ ] normal Through works
- [ ] Through into an existing cavity/tunnel works
- [ ] continuing through a cavity to a farther outer wall works
- [ ] multiple ordered Through targets work where supported
- [ ] invalid Through topology rolls back cleanly
- [ ] unrelated Extrude/Inset behaviour is unchanged after Through edits

## Clean for SubD / Quad Clean

- [ ] Clean for SubD button is available in Object > Active Tools
- [ ] locked/reference objects cannot be destructively cleaned
- [ ] safe four-triangle fan repair works
- [ ] conservative sliver/skinny-triangle repair works
- [ ] bounded even triangle islands can be proposed up to the current 40-triangle envelope
- [ ] a safe 40-triangle strip can resolve to 20 quads
- [ ] a 42-triangle connected island remains outside the bounded complete-matching stage
- [ ] poor-quality patches are preserved rather than forced
- [ ] surrounding quad-flow context influences candidate quality
- [ ] internal proposed-quad flow coherence influences candidate quality
- [ ] coherent neighboring proposed quads score better than an equivalent zig-zag internal flow arrangement
- [ ] completed-patch ranking prefers smooth interior vertices closer to quad valence 4 when safe alternatives exist
- [ ] crease/boundary-protected vertices are excluded from valence regularity scoring
- [ ] equal-average valence alternatives prefer the patch with the lower worst local valence error
- [ ] equal-average internal-flow alternatives prefer the patch with the lower worst local flow mismatch
- [ ] topology audit accepts valid open-boundary meshes
- [ ] topology audit rejects duplicate/non-manifold/collapsed topology deterministically
- [ ] core Clean for SubD pipeline is transactional and restores the original mesh if a stage fails its topology audit
- [ ] generated irregular triangulated-strip fixtures remain topologically valid after cleanup
- [ ] safe remaining triangle pairs can merge to quads
- [ ] all-quad tangent relaxation remains guarded
- [ ] topology validation rejects/rolls back invalid results
- [ ] no-change result reports safely without corrupting the mesh
- [ ] Undo/Redo remains valid after a clean operation

## Boolean / extraction

- [ ] Boolean workflow works
- [ ] Boolean cleanup does not leave duplicate/degenerate faces
- [ ] Extract + Undo works
- [ ] Extract + Redo works

## Modifiers / display

- [ ] Mirror X works
- [ ] Mirror Y works
- [ ] Mirror Z works
- [ ] Align Object to Mirror works where enabled
- [ ] SubD Preview works
- [ ] Show Cage works
- [ ] SubD levels 1–4 behave correctly
- [ ] Studio realtime mode works
- [ ] multiple objects display correctly in Studio
- [ ] ground plane / lighting does not incorrectly follow only the active object

## Import / export

- [ ] Editable OBJ import works
- [ ] Editable GLB/GLTF import works where supported
- [ ] Reference import works
- [ ] Base OBJ export works
- [ ] multi-object Base OBJ export works
- [ ] SubD OBJ export works
- [ ] multi-object SubD OBJ export works

## History / transaction safety

- [ ] Undo works after the changed workflow
- [ ] Redo works after the changed workflow
- [ ] failed topology operations restore the pre-operation mesh
- [ ] object-manager state remains synchronized after geometry commits
- [ ] no partial mutation remains after a rejected operation

## UI / release integrity

- [ ] visible app version matches intended release
- [ ] module cache pins changed only where intended
- [ ] `styles.css?v=0.36.18.270` remains pinned unless deliberately changed
- [ ] `src/multi-object-transform.js?v=0.36.1.0` remains untouched unless deliberately changed
- [ ] `component-multi-init.js?v=0.36.18.314` remains present/pinned unless component-selection startup is deliberately changed
- [ ] drawer behaviour remains intact
- [ ] no service worker was introduced unintentionally
- [ ] GitHub Pages loads the intended build after release

## Session-specific additions

Add new permanent regression checks below when future features need protection.
