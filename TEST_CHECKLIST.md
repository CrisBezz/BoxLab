## .1054 — release identity repair and material map previews

- [ ] After Pages reports `.1054`, refresh and confirm the app release marker says `.1054`.
- [ ] In UV Paint → Layers, confirm Roughness and Metalness tiles show saved maps in grayscale; white means rough/metal and black means smooth/non-metal.
- [ ] Open an object with only one scalar map. Confirm the other tile says “No map” and does not show stale data from another object.
- [ ] Paint Roughness, then Metalness, and confirm each tile refreshes without changing Colour layer thumbnails.
- [ ] Compare map tiles with the Lit material; check whether apparent white patches align with Colour pixels, Metalness values, or both.
- [ ] Retest `.1049` fixes: metal-only and combined-map shadow strength; switch brush then paint again; Pencil background orbit followed by Total Gizmo rotation.

`.1053` Pages (`41293655018`) succeeded and live files matched `main`. Its hosted Topology run had 3,094 PASS / 2 FAIL: the `.1041` preserved-release check still expected `.1052`, and shell-comparison headings remained `.1052`. `.1054` updates the visible labels and preserved release assertion; prior logs remain accepted. No local tests were run or added. Commit `889ab5a226245cd62a030a8baf415b881c61f716` is on `main`; Pages `41294085210` succeeded; live `.1054` index, shell-comparison and runtime asset manifest match `main`. Hosted Topology `41294085728` is still running. Verify live assets and hosted regression before hands-on checks.

# BoxLab manual test checklist

## .1049 — stronger painted Metalness shadows and stable Pencil Paint/orbit handoff

- [ ] In Studio, paint Metalness on a surface with no Colour map. Confirm the shadow remains visible and has stronger contrast than .1048.
- [ ] Repeat with both Colour and Metalness maps. Confirm both painted responses and the shadow remain visible; compare shadow strength with metal-only.
- [ ] In UV Paint, paint a stroke, switch among Brush, Eraser or Smudge, then paint again on the mesh. Confirm the second stroke paints rather than orbiting.
- [ ] In UV Paint, Pencil-drag empty background to orbit, then rotate the object with Total Gizmo. Confirm orbit does not leave the gizmo unusable.
- [x] Separate material-channel painting and Paint toolbars PASS; .1048 combined Colour+Metalness shadow presence PASS with reduced strength noted; .1047 metal-only shadow case PASS; .1046 Smudge PASS remain protected.

Automated .1049 coverage: focused material/Pencil/gizmo/shell/release set 42 PASS / 0 FAIL; full Node suite 3,096 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 skipped (296.37s). Changed JS syntax, reviewed runtime pin/hash contract, protected Multi pin, and `git diff --check` pass. Hosted Topology regression `41289594202` passed. Pages run `41289594359` failed twice because GitHub says the prior `.1048` deployment is still in progress; live `version.json` remains `.1048`, so .1049 is not yet available for device testing. Focused regressions exercise `.55` Metalness fill with both shadow flags, active-Paint mesh Pencil routing after brush changes versus background orbit, matching-pointer gizmo cancellation, and preserved gizmo rotation behavior. Native iPad rendering and Pencil feel must be confirmed after Pages is unblocked and the checks above can be run.


## .1047 — separate Paint channels and metal-only shadow

User confirms painting Metalness and Colour through their separate channels/toolbar flow PASS. The Colour-map case with Metalness loses the shadow; `.1048` fixes that combined-material path. The orbit test was not reported again and remains a hands-on check.

## .1046 — Metalness shading and stronger Smudge — user report

The .1046 Metalness-only shading claim did not pass on device: the user saw no shadow following Metalness painting without a Colour map. The stronger Smudge behavior passed and is protected. The .1047 shadow contrast repair addresses the reported case.


## .1045 — combined material strokes and UV Paint input/menu fixes — user PASS protected

User replied **1045 PASS** on 1 November 2026. Protect combined scalar strokes, Lit Paint preview, Pencil orbit, direct Brush menu and the .1045 Smudge behavior. The report also identifies a Metalness-only Studio shading restoration defect and asks for stronger Smudge; .1046 covers these fixes.


- [x] Open the Brush radial action. It should go straight to **Material & Paint**; the
  previous Brush controls screen should not appear first. Confirm Colour, Roughness,
  Metalness, brush size, stroke opacity and tip controls are present.
- [x] Enable “Also paint in this stroke” for Roughness and Metalness. Paint one Colour
  stroke, then deselect the object and confirm the three maps remain visible together.
  Undo once should remove all changes; Redo should restore all three.
- [x] Select Roughness and Metalness as the primary paint channel. Confirm preview stays
  Lit. Exit Paint with Done and confirm the normal Studio/Solid appearance and shadows return.
- [x] In Paint, move Pencil over empty viewport background and orbit; then paint a surface.
  Confirm a finger still orbits/pans/zooms and a finger already navigating blocks a new Pencil
  contact until it lifts.
- [x] Paint across two colours with Smudge. Drag from one into the other and confirm the
  mixed colour travels with the brush; test a connected folded edge and confirm it does not
  sample unrelated UV islands.
- [x] Open Fill, Eraser, Smudge and Blur from the wheel. Confirm each panel contains only
  its relevant controls, Tools returns to the wheel, and the floating palette remains draggable.

Automated .1045 validation: full Node suite 3,091 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 skipped before the final
in-place Smudge reservoir allocation optimization. Final post-optimization focused material,
Smudge, release identity and shell checks passed 34 / 34. The broader Paint, Pencil-navigation
and cache-contract set passed 43 / 43 before that allocation-only optimization. Syntax checks
and `git diff --check` pass.
The user has now confirmed native .1045 behavior PASS. The Metalness restoration and Smudge strength reports are tracked under .1046.

Published on `main` as commit `a505c803f92da39b07747d4acb53b2aa31a7d2b3`; Pages `41257090423` and Topology regression `41257090347` succeeded. Version/shell and all nine changed or loader runtime modules byte-match cache-busted live files. Native iPad acceptance for .1045 is confirmed PASS; .1046 device acceptance is pending.


## .1044 — UV Paint material & values menu — device test pending

- [ ] Enter UV Paint and confirm preview remains Lit material mode. Choose Colour,
  Roughness and Metalness as paint channels; material lighting must remain visible.
- [ ] Open the radial wheel and confirm its Material swatch shows current colour and
  brush-stroke opacity. Open Material & Paint from the swatch and from the quick-panel
  header; both routes should show the same unified menu.
- [ ] Change colour with the picker and Hex/RGB/HSB values. Confirm the swatch and
  readout update. Adjust size and stroke opacity; the alpha preview must update.
- [ ] Choose Roughness then Metalness. Confirm both paint-value sliders stay available
  and the active channel is highlighted; paint a small test patch in each.
- [ ] Confirm Map Size and AO are absent from the radial and available at the bottom
  of the Layers page. Open/close each page and return to Layers/Brush.
- [ ] Drag the radial wheel and expanded menu to different viewport corners. Confirm
  the menu remains bounded and Pencil strokes, finger navigation, Undo/Redo still work.

BoxLab retains imported material opacity maps but does not paint their texture channel.
The swatch alpha represents brush stroke opacity.

Published: commit `f598df16eb592ab7eac91d9d45dec862b287a384`; Pages deployment
41251195407 succeeded. Hosted Topology regression 41251196062 passed: 3,086 PASS /
0 FAIL / 0 skipped. The prior .1044 run failed on stale release/UI assertions; the
listed fixes are in `f598df1`. Native iPad acceptance is pending.

## .1043 — contextual Paint help and copy audit — device test pending

- [ ] The floating Paint controls show a small “i” help button. Tap it on iPad to
  open and close the tooltip; it must not start a stroke or move the palette.
- [ ] Switch Brush, Fill, Blur, Eraser, Roughness, Metalness and Mask contexts; check
  the help text follows the active tool/scope/channel and remains readable on screen.
- [ ] Confirm the help popover does not obstruct the controls needed to set colour,
  size, opacity, Fill scope or scalar values.
- [ ] Run the still-pending .1042 drag, Pencil, finger navigation and Undo/Redo checks
  below; the tooltip change must preserve those behaviors.
- [ ] Confirm the File menu now describes supported NOM material maps accurately.

Automated .1043 checks: full Node suite 3,086 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 skipped. Focused
Paint/context-help, release-contract and shell-comparison checks pass. This does not
establish native touch/visual acceptance, which remains with the user.
Publication: .1043 is live from GitHub main commit
`3e3f8c95c3fd62400f0d1ccc22c514cad1977d49`. Pages workflow 41246780287 succeeded.
Topology regression workflow 41246780922 is running; native iPad acceptance is pending.

## .1042 — UV Paint draggable contextual palette — device test pending

- [x] The tool wheel is smaller/lighter; dragging its grab handle relocates it and keeps
  it inside the viewport. Position persists while Paint stays open.
- [x] Choosing Brush, Fill, Eraser, Smudge or Blur opens contextual quick controls;
  Tools returns to the wheel.
- [x] The quick panel reuses the original channel/preview, colour, brush size/opacity,
  fill, blur/scalar and mask-value nodes and listeners. The layer list remains in the
  persistent left Paint panel.
- [ ] On iPad, drag the wheel/panel to different corners and check controls remain
  reachable in both wheel and quick-control states.
- [ ] Adjust colour, brush size and opacity; switch to Fill and a scalar or Mask target
  to confirm the relevant controls update and disabled options stay unavailable.
- [ ] Paint with Pencil; verify fingers still orbit/pan/zoom, tool changes do not commit
  strokes, and Undo/Redo plus Done retain their existing behavior.

Automated .1042 coverage: 3,085 Node tests pass, including focused Paint/compact-layout
and release-contract checks. Hosted Topology regression 41201732663 and Pages deployment
41201732616 succeeded. The live shell, manifest, Paint module, compact stylesheet and
loader chain match the tested tree byte-for-byte. These checks do not establish iPad touch,
visual weight or GPU rendering acceptance; device checks above remain pending.

## .1041 — displacement feasibility report received (benchmark only)

- [x] The .1041 page ran all nine generated-map render combinations on the iPad; no
  case stopped early. This confirms the gate and its copyable report work.
- [x] Largest generated case: 16,384 output faces / 65,536 UV corners; UV subdivision
  21 ms median, geometry expansion 5–8 ms, expanded arrays 3 MiB.
- [x] 2048² generated PNG decoded in 48 ms; estimated base RGBA 16 MiB. RAF intervals
  were 17 ms median and 17–18 ms p95. GPU timer query was unavailable.

Interpretation: favorable bounded CPU/frame-scheduling evidence, not a product PASS or
GPU/memory safety proof. The benchmark used a single mesh and generated 8-bit maps; it
did not test actual Nomad 16-bit decode, BoxLab viewport time, shadows or full memory.
Next validation must audit the actual retained Nomad displacement image and the native
factor/midpoint/world settings before preview implementation. Keep current viewport
20,000-corner and aggregate-image budgets. No displacement feature is enabled in .1041.

Automated .1041 coverage checks the benchmark entry point, canonical corner-UV kernel,
displacement shader usage, case caps, timeout/report contract and release markers. The
full Node suite passed 3,083 / 0 / 0; live .1041 Pages deployment was verified.

## .1040 — textured SubD on inactive NOM objects — user PASS protected

- [x] Open the seven-object NOM sample. Confirm all seven base materials appear;
  the user PASS for this non-SubD behavior is protected from .1039.
- [x] Enable SubD on at least two textured objects. Confirm both remain textured
  while unselected; then select each and deselect all. Check Studio and Solid.
- [x] Toggle SubD off/on and change the active object; confirm texture alignment.
- [x] Enable Mirror on a textured SubD object and confirm the established
  untextured fallback; disable Mirror and confirm the texture preview returns.
- [x] Switch/reopen VIEW and orbit/pan; confirm preview and navigation remain.

Scope: editable NOM source with current UV topology, no Mirror, and within the
existing 20,000-corner preview cap. References, linked/recipe objects, stale UVs,
Mirror and over-cap results retain the untextured SubD fallback. This does not approve
displacement, texture decode/memory use, GPU behavior or rendered frame time.

Automated .1040 regression covers per-object UV-aware caches, shared eligibility,
inactive Studio/Solid overlay handoff and cleanup. Existing active SubD and NOM
material regressions remain covered. Full Node suite: 3,081 PASS / 0 FAIL. Release
asset-contract and version-marker checks pass. Hosted topology regression
41187547119 and Pages deployment 41187546752 succeeded. Live `.1040` marker and
seven changed runtime assets match local bytes. User confirms all objects retain
their materials under SubD, including while unselected; protect this iPad behavior.

## .1039 — active textured SubD; base-material PASS, inactive gap reported

The user confirmed all seven base materials displayed correctly in .1039. The follow-
up test found that only the selected object displayed its material after SubD was
enabled on multiple objects. The .1040 checklist above covers this repair.

## .1037 user PASS protected — corner UV subdivision

User replied PASS after the .1037 release. Protect seam-preserving per-corner UV propagation, unchanged geometry-only SubD behavior and the16,384-face/80,000-corner refusal limits. The helper is currently not connected to viewport rendering. Existing seven-object loading, VIEW stability and .1035 colour-alpha PASS remain protected.

## .1035 — pre-decode native colour alpha OFF repair — 31 October 2026

USER .1034 FAIL: screenshot shows right cube cyan/black checker on visible .1034.
.1033 standalone material PASS remains protected; .1034 shader-only claim was
insufficient. Three map_fragment multiplies RGB by sampled RGB, and alpha by
sampled alpha componentwise; it does NOT itself multiply RGB by sampled alpha.
Shader string tests cannot prove RGB survived browser PNG decode/resize.

Existing surface owner now passes an explicit alpha-OFF flag to its default
surface decoder. Existing nomad-scalar-png owner makes a transient opaque PNG
BEFORE createImageBitmap: unfilters original pixels, keeps original RGB including
alpha-zero pixels, sets preview alpha255, and recompresses. Shared GLB/UV decoder
has no native dependency. Explicit alpha ON and auxiliary channels keep original
decoding; source bytes, material metadata, UVs, Save/Open/NOM remain unchanged.
No source texture rewrite, canvas RGB recovery, new renderer or modelling kernel.

Supported pre-decode path: noninterlaced 8-bit RGBA/grayscale-alpha PNG; tRNS
transparency stripped for other native PNG types. Profiles/colour chunks retained.
Bounds: encoded source/output8MiB, dimensions2048 and4M source pixels, inflate output
exact expected scanline length; CRC/truncation/filter/animation/16bit-alpha refusals.
Unsupported alpha-OFF conversion keeps original body fallback, no black-map guess.
Existing GPU preview limits/lifetimes and .1033 standalone reservation remain intact.

Regression checks inspect actual browser-input PNG from original .1029 fixture:
all alpha-OFF texels exactly [55,175,220,255]; alpha ON still [55,175,220,0/255].
All five PNG filters tested with varied hidden RGB, tRNS and grayscale-alpha,
malformed/oversized/inflate overflow refused. Actual surface default decoder and
source-exact NOM roundtrip covered. Corrected .1034 alpha-ON test: default Three
onBeforeCompile is a no-op; Three expands map_fragment after that hook. .1034 CI
41152868866 FAILED; repair supersedes it only after passing validation/publication.
Restore DEV_HISTORY content from3397d287, which .1034 documentation accidentally
replaced, then retain .1034 entry and append this repair. Other old docs kept intact.
Reviewed cache closure repinned; stale .1034 index-only keys reconciled with owners.
Restore original five-step structural A/B checklist (1034 extra material step broke
completion); material check stays in build instructions. Correct stale1033 titles
and preserve1033/1034 result logs. Original13 checklist regression tests PASS.

DEVICE1035: use original docs/samples/NOM_COLOUR_ALPHA_1029.nom, Studio and Solid.
RIGHT solid cyan, no black squares; LEFT checker transparency; MIDDLE combined
alpha plus opacity. Switch/reopen VIEW; original .1032 seven-cube Colour cyan;
.1033 standalone sample unchanged. Move/UndoRedo and Save/Open/NOM retention.
Native iPad/GPU appearance acceptance still pending; do not claim device success.
Displacement remains deferred; next step is actual device validation before more work.
Validation: Node22 full suite3064 PASS/0FAIL (216.65s); focused13 material tests
and final13 checklist tests PASS. git diff --check clean. CI41154726829 and Pages41154726211 SUCCESS; live bytes verified. .1034 iPad FAIL remains recorded; .1035 GPU/device acceptance pending.

## .1034 — native colour alpha OFF shader correction — 31 October 2026

Current runtime target: 0.36.18.1034. Parent .1033 user PASS is protected,
including standalone PBR maps, seven-object import and VIEW stability.

Audit found the precise alpha-OFF defect in the existing native UV surface owner:
the RGB-only map shader hook was installed only when opacityMode() ran. A native
colour texture with use_color_opacity=false and no separate opacity map therefore
fell through to Three's default diffuseColor *= sampledDiffuseColor, multiplying
the constant cyan RGB by the image's checker alpha and producing black squares.
The original owner now installs the RGB-only shader hook for every supported lit
native colour surface with colour alpha OFF. opacityMode reuses the same hook when
a separate opacity map/factor also controls transparency. Explicit colour alpha ON
keeps Three's original RGBA sampling path; opacity, depth-write, shadow and source
byte behaviour are otherwise unchanged. No decoder rewrite or image re-encoding.

New actual-owner tests cover alpha OFF without a separate opacity map and explicit
alpha ON retaining RGBA. In-app TEST LIST adds the original comparison file:
docs/samples/NOM_COLOUR_ALPHA_1029.nom (left alpha ON, middle combined opacity,
right alpha OFF). Existing seven-object and standalone-map samples remain unchanged.
Displacement remains inspection/retention only.

Validation/publication status: source/test changes committed to main; local suite
not available in this connected session. Hosted CI and Pages/live byte verification
are pending and must be checked before calling this build fully released.
Native iPad/GPU appearance acceptance is pending.

DEVICE1034: import NOM_COLOUR_ALPHA_1029.nom in Studio and Solid. Right cube must be
solid cyan with no checker/black squares; left cube retains checker transparency;
middle retains combined colour-alpha plus separate opacity. Switch VIEW modes,
orbit, select/Move/UndoRedo, and verify prior .1033 standalone-map sample still works.
Next: confirm .1034 alpha behaviour, then separately benchmark displacement/subdivision
before implementation. Do not fold displacement into this shader correction.

## .1033 user PASS protected — 31 October 2026

User replied PASS after .1033 standalone-material test build. Protect accepted
standalone normal/emissive/roughness/metalness/opacity preview through existing
owners, six supported mapped cubes, seven-object loading, VIEW stability and
previous accepted behaviour. No new application build in this update.
This PASS does not close the separately deferred displacement preview or the
original .1032 alpha-OFF colour discrepancy (new .1033 sample uses opaque RGB).
Next narrow build: repair original alpha-OFF colour bitmap decode/resampling,
preserving RGB beneath transparent pixels without changing retained source bytes.
Then audit displacement preview subdivision/performance gates before implementation.
Current status: .1033 LIVE, user PASS; awaiting next /nextbuild for runtime work.
Optional regression: original .1032 Colour cube should eventually be solid cyan
with colour opacity OFF; enabling opacity should reveal its alpha checker.

Publication: application commit bbe1896581176abdfb297404161d5023b3d9a26a,
reviewed tree 8554d21a5068f6f38b0feb1d825bcd0c043643b0, fetched main verified.

Topology regression41150968538 completed SUCCESS. .1033 LIVE and READY FOR TESTING.
Manual iPad appearance acceptance remains pending; .1032 loading/VIEW PASS protected.

## .1033 — standalone native material maps — 31 October 2026

Current build: 0.36.18.1033. Parent main: 1cd744b63ff35cafea7a56b01c0cfbd81b53645f.
Reuses nomad-material-resource and uv-image-surface-preview: Studio/Solid now
accept normal, emissive, roughness, metalness and opacity maps without a colour
image, using native constant color (white default), roughness .25, metalness 0.
No generated colour texture or parallel renderer. Invalid existing colour bindings,
unlit, unsupported projections/materials and displacement-only keep prior fallback.
Map-only overlay replaces body only after a successful decode; failed/late work
releases the original owner and reservation. Source images/UVs/materials remain exact.

Protect explicit .1032 user PASS: seven-cube visibility/spacing and VIEW stability.
Four colour surfaces remain protected; up to eight map-only surfaces share original
aggregate ceilings: 15M decoded pixels, 80k UV corners, 32MiB encoded sources.
Per-map limits unchanged. Parent loader changes are cache-pin-only. main.js and
multi-object-transform remain untouched; no broad UI changes.

Fresh comparison: docs/samples/NOM_STANDALONE_MAPS_1033.nom. Seven independent
named cubes, same accepted spacing; TRUE opaque RGB checker for Colour and
Emissive. .1032 fixture remains immutable. Displacement stays retention/inspection
only, pending subdivision/performance work. Original .1032 alpha-OFF cyan/black
bitmap discrepancy remains OPEN and is not fixed by the new sample.

Hands-on pending: import new sample, verify all seven cubes and six supported
material channels in Studio/Solid; inspect gloss/reflections while orbiting.
Check opacity holes and shadows, switch/reopen all VIEW modes, Move/Undo/Redo,
Save/Open and export NOM. User PASS required for actual iPad/GPU appearance.
Next: address alpha-OFF bitmap decoding separately after this material validation.
Validation: Node22 full suite 3058 PASS, 0 FAIL (102.29s); final additional budget check and all four .1033 focused tests PASS on Node22. Existing 30 native material tests PASS. git diff --check clean. Hosted CI41150968538 and Pages41150967831 SUCCESS; live bytes verified.

## .1032 explicit user acceptance — 31 October 2026

- [x] User1032 PASS: all7 cubes visible; no VIEW mode disappearance. Protect sample spacing and VIEW startup/mode availability/reopen.
- [ ] OPEN: native Normal/Emissive/Roughness/Metalness/Opacity without colour texture still falls back to plain3D shading; retained maps remain inspectable. No standalone-PBR PASS inferred.
- [ ] OPEN: sample colour RGB is constant cyan with alpha checker OFF. Nomad solid cyan expected; BoxLab checker/black squares require alphaOFF decoder/material investigation. Use opaque RGB checker in future comparison fixture.
- [ ] Displacement viewport remains deferred; inspection/export retention only.
- [x] Documentation-only acceptance/source audit; runtime remains1032, no new build/manual mandatory test.

## .1032 — repair .1031 FAIL — 31 October 2026

- [x] Classic head captures immutable shell identity before comparison/modules; actual OBJ exporter cannot write app version in either initialization order.
- [x] Original release owner repairs label AND dataset; metadata contamination before initialization, attribute-only mutation, arbitrary stamp argument, newer manifest and offline return cannot relabel loaded code.
- [x] Real OBJ Base/SubD wrapper output equals original production core with internal450 stamp; source mesh remains unchanged. Existing MIME/round-trip tests retained.
- [x] Comparison uses immutable identity, independently stamps1009, preserves exact1006/1007/1008 ratings/notes/first failures, and never copies PASS into new loads.
- [x]Full local2945 PASS/0FAIL/0skip/0cancel (117.67s).48 focused checks PASS; old actual exporter fails new regression. Protected Multi1.0/frozen/model/Paint/UV owners unchanged.
- [ ]DEVICE1009 visible app/checklist1009 and new Copy observations shellRelease1009; retain historical450 metadata unchanged.
- [ ]Alternate A/B with in-app controls, same resolution/orientation/default cube, startup FIRST; original five visible checks. Beta screen gate remains OPEN.
- [ ]B extended parity: navigation/selection/gizmo, UV Back/Paint Done, UndoRedo and SaveOpen before default adoption. No device1009 acceptance inferred from Node.

## .1008 native comparison results — 28 October 2026

User supplied Copy results at2026-10-28T11:41:00.510Z (21:41 Brisbane).
A/current:6 complete .1008 runs:2 all-five FAIL,4 all-five PASS;1 additional
unrated .1008 load excluded. B/separated:5 complete all-five PASS,0 FAIL;
1 four-of-five PASS (Paint unrated) and1 unrated load excluded from complete count.
Older .1006 partial/unrated records excluded. Protect the reported PASS observations
for those runs; they do not erase A failures or establish permanent screen repair.
See docs/shell-comparison-results-1008.md for run IDs, audit and next gate.

Both profiles report1366x886 CSS viewport, DPR2,1366x826 canvas CSS/backing,
requested1 and savedStartup1. A failed twice after saved1x startup: first-allocation
1x is NOT sufficient prevention. A canvas parent viewportWrap; B parent
boxlabComparisonCanvasSurface confirms actual structural switch without dimensions
change. A first-failure snapshot is STARTUP: closed VIEW / hidden gizmo there are
expected states, NOT proof those nodes were incorrectly hidden at later checks.

All new observations say checklistRelease1008 but shellRelease450. Audited live-main
source: src/scene-obj-export-238.js lines5-11 hardcode450 and overwrite BOTH label
text and dataset.releaseVersion. The diagnostic reads that mutable dataset; therefore
450 is contaminated metadata, NOT evidence an old450 HTML shell was loaded. .1008
running-shell identity fix is incomplete: release-version can capture contaminated
data depending on module order; current test only covers text overwrite, not dataset
mutation by the real exporter. Next narrow runtime work must remove secondary release
writes/use an immutable initial shell identity and regression-test the actual writer.
Do not change OBJ geometry/export behavior or ask for repeated cache clearing.

Decision: B is promising, not proven. A failed then had4 healthy runs BEFORE B;
time/order confounding prevents attributing B health solely to separation. Keep beta
screen gate OPEN. Next native gate: interleave A/B through original in-app reload
controls (same1x/orientation/default cube; startup first), then B navigation/selection/
gizmo/UV/Paint/UndoRedo/save-open parity before adopting B as default. No wholesale
interface reskin or duplicate tool/renderer/kernel. No additional runtime shipped in
this feedback session; .1008 remains live. No tests rerun for documentation only.

## .1008 — running-code identity and unobstructed UV test controls — 28 October 2026

- [x] Screenshot confirms apparent1007 and blocked A UV return; first3 A PASS toggles observed for ONE run, no broad rendering PASS inferred.
- [x] Network latest may differ; displayed version/title stay on loaded shell through pageshow/visibilitychange/legacy overwrite; no forced recovery.
- [x] Direct/nested release owner use same1008 URL; layout/drawer parent pins refreshed, protected Multi1.0 unchanged.
- [x] Actual runner Hide removes full list; small left-centre TEST LIST reopens with ratings preserved. Independent checklist .1008 stamp.
- [x] Actual app/UV hidden-state observer drives inline docking, restores on Back, stops on Hide/pagehide and resumes appropriately; no viewport/model writes.
- [x]1006/1007 records and notes retain original release; fresh1008 results remain unrated.

## .1007 — checklist must clear UV exit controls — 28 October 2026

- [x] User1006 A UV check blocked by test list; do not count as native compositor evidence.
- [x] 34 focused comparison/original UV/VIEW/release checks PASS, including exact1006 log migration and unrated new1007 load.

- [ ] Back/Close returns checklist to normal top-left; viewport size/resolution/UV/history/navigation unchanged.
- [ ] Copy results retains1006 entries/notes/ratings/failure evidence tagged1006, new runs tagged1007; no prior PASS auto-copied.

## .1006 — shell comparison regression and native gate — 28 October 2026

- [x]1004 Fill behaviour explicitly user PASS; preserve accepted Face/Facegroup/Object scopes and hold/history.
- [x]1005 screen explicitly FAIL: empty Facegroup menu / missing bottom-right status at startup; beta blocker remains OPEN.

## .1005 device feedback — Fill PASS; screen FAIL — 28 October 2026

User explicitly PASSes Fill behaviour. Protect1004 Face/Facegroup/Whole object Fill,
hold expansion, original raster/input/history owners and current accepted UI; no
new Fill changes requested. This acceptance supersedes pending Fill gates below.
User explicitly FAILs screen behaviour: Facegroup menu still empty. During refresh,
bottom-right startup messages normally settle to Face mode / nothing selected / Multi;
absence of that message lets user identify the failed right region immediately.
This is a useful startup symptom before opening the menu, not proof of an empty
selection/group model, failed status writer or a specific browser-engine cause.
Original main.updateStatus owns status text; existing Multi initialization can update
its wording. Status footer and VIEW use different UI owners; no missing shared action
or confirmed common application clip established. No speculative runtime/CSS repair.
Fresh saved1x launch is NOT verified by this feedback alone: no savedStartup/requested/
backing dimensions supplied. Confirm whether Keep1x on reload was enabled before the
failed refresh before declaring first-allocation1x disproven. Prior live1x recurrence
and current screen FAIL retained; do not claim1005 repaired visibility or request the
same old diagnostics. Current runtime1005; no new build or tests in this feedback update.
User now identifies this as a blocker for the next beta and asks whether an interface
rebuild is appropriate. Recommended next engineering direction: controlled shell
isolation/reconstruction with existing tool/DOM/action owners, same accepted appearance,
and native startup/reload comparison; no wholesale reskin or duplicate kernels.
This is a proposal, not implemented or claimed to guarantee a rendering repair.

## .1005 continuation audit — 28 October 2026

Audited current main dbc716d4 (runtime 698ef508); no runtime changes or new build.
Fresh local Node24.22.1 full regression: 2926 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 skipped (109.81s).
Hosted regression40626823442 and Pages40626977468 completed SUCCESS.
Live version/index/main/viewport-sizing/gesture-debug all byte-match current main;
release markers and reviewed1005 sizing/debug/parent pins agree; protected Multi1.0 retained.
Existing1004 Face/Facegroup/Whole object Fill and1005 saved-startup1x reuse their
original owners. Neither has new device acceptance; right-region visibility remains OPEN.
Next: DEVICE1005 saved1x fresh reload, then DEVICE1004 Pencil Fill/hold/UndoRedo.
Obtain that result before another speculative rendering change; do not infer a repair
from automated regression or healthy DOM/hit tests. No PASS inferred from this audit.

## .1005 — opt-in startup 1x, after .1004 recurrence — 28 October 2026

User reports right-side failure following refresh to1004. Report03:21:34Z confirms
requested1x AND actual1366x826 backing (CSS1366x826/DPR2). No stale release or failed
live resolution switch. Startup logged at1489/pageshow3188; at7715 canvas2732x1652,
then1x requested7831 and1366x826 by11190. Thus failure persists in captured1x state,
but this launch began at2x. Earlier1x stability is NOT a reliable repair. Current-
resolution-only/2048 WebGL-backing-limit explanation is insufficient. Initial2x
allocation remains a hypothesis, not proven cause. Do not say1x cannot fail.

Capture: Studio/Face, no session/Paint, VIEW correctly closed/hidden with zero bounds,
no atmosphere, UV workspace absent. Visible DOM gizmo196x196 at753.69/408.77;
its right edge949.69 is short of earlier1024CSS cutoff. This report does not capture
where visible gizmo pixels disappear. Toolbar DOM/hits healthy; no visual success
inferred. Nothing ties fault to new1004 fill.1004 feature acceptance remains pending.

New File -> UI Debug -> Keep1× on reload explicitly saves1x launch preference and
applies current1x. Same button becomes Use normal on reload to remove preference.
Original temporary Test1×/Restore normal controls retained. Debug off/pagehide now
restore SAVED launch preference (normal when none), rather than always clearing1x.
Default normal capped2 unchanged for users who do not opt in. localStorage denial/
invalid values fall back to normal; failed save reported honestly, no false success.
Snapshot includes savedStartup; debug-startup now records requested/saved/backing size.
No automatic blink/reload, CSS/GPU-hint/menu/gizmo/geometry/history/paint changes.

Original sizing owner reads preference before binding; existing main immediate
resize now reads initialized owner request, so FIRST full drawing-buffer allocation
can be1x, not initial2x followed by delayed downgrade. Coalesced sizing remains only
lifecycle owner. Explicit change refusal while tools/Paint/drag/probes busy retained.
Tests execute actual first main allocation (1366x826x1, no2x intermediate), saved
binding restart, reset/pagehide/default restoration, storage failure/invalid values,
actual buttons/snapshot and nearby viewport/UV/Paint. Publication/results recorded
in docs/publication-1005.md. No native pixel repair claimed; right-region gate OPEN.

DEVICE1005: Finish tools -> File/UI Debug -> Keep1× on reload. Confirm button reads
Use normal on reload, then refresh ONCE. Inspect right toolbar/menu/gizmo immediately
and after normal navigation. Copy report if failure returns; savedStartup1 plus
requested1/backing1366x826 establishes fresh1x launch. Debug off keeps saved1x. Use
normal on reload restores original resolution if wanted. No repeated cache-clearing
or identical old diagnostics requested.1004 Fill behavior retained; not marked PASS.

## .1004 — UV Paint Fill Face / Facegroup and hold expansion — 28 October 2026

User reports1x seems to stay healthy and explicitly parks right-region testing unless
it recurs. Record provisional1x stability only, not proven root cause/permanent fix.
Keep1003 sizing/debug bytes and default automatic DPR unchanged;1x is still temporary
and resets on reload/Debug off/pagehide. Resume requested UV Paint fill expansion.

Original Fill radial sector remains in its accepted position/artwork. Compact LEFT
settings add Face (default), Facegroup and Whole object scope. Pencil/mouse tap fills
clicked original polygon, not one rendered triangle. Face hold420ms expands preview
to connected coplanar region; up grows/down shrinks from fixed planar base in30px
steps with18px neutral band (max32 steps); right uses original Face Loop and left
Face Ring. Direction reversal recomputes baseline pixels rather than accumulating
opacity. Before hold, movement>8px cancels tap. Release commits one original paint
checkpoint; cancel/scope/tool/body/history loss restores baseline and clears timer.
Fingers still navigate. Scope changes never alter modelling selection or Facegroups.

Facegroup scope shows SAME orange non-pickable boundary preview as UV seam review;
click fills all same-name faces on target, including disconnected patches. Ungrouped
faces refuse with assignment hint. Scope exit/Done/body loss disposes overlay;
world matrix follows original body. UV review now shares extracted original boundary
renderer, retaining its exact seams/colour/timer/unwrap/cancellation behavior.

Copied existing read-only Coplanar inspect, quad-strip trace and Grow/Shrink math to
shared face-selection-regions; ORIGINAL selection UI owners call those same functions.
No duplicate geometry kernel or selection simulation. Raster original fill accepts
optional texel mask and baseline replacement; coverage/alpha/opacity/scalar/mask,
resource/pool validation, scene history, SaveOpen/export remain original owners.
Face masks use original UV texel ownership; require non-overlapping, nondegenerate
UVs in tile0–1, original bounded geometry/work limits. Shared/ambiguous boundary
texels stay conservative; no painting onto a different face's owned interior texels.
Whole object fill retains earlier behavior. Existing image-colour refusal retained.

Reviewed1004 reverse cache closure: shared modules, selection owners/Coplanar drawer,
paint raster/core/UI and Lab loaders, UV workflow/MeshHealth, shell/recovery. Internal
stamps retained. Main1003, viewport sizing/debug1003, accepted uniform Facegroups1002,
SVG/gizmo/right-region composition, palette, Multi1.0 and frozen releases unchanged.
Tests: actual region/painter/UI/UndoRedo/subset SaveOpen, preview reversal/opacity,
all-name group fill/overlay cleanup, original selection gestures and paint suite.
Legacy926/927 UI fixtures now explicitly choose Whole object for their full-texture
assertions; original pixel/UndoRedo/SaveOpen/native-export protections retained.
Test adapters import extracted real selection functions; no behavioral assertions
removed. Results and publication evidence: docs/publication-1004.md.

DEVICE1004: UV Paint -> Fill -> Face; tap one polygon, then hold on coplanar patch,
slide up/down and right/left, release; reversing/shrinking removes abandoned preview.
UndoRedo one gesture. Choose Facegroup: orange boundaries visible; tap named group,
only that group's faces fill; Brush/Done removes boundaries. Whole object still fills
all; SaveOpen retains paint. No new right-side diagnostic test requested. If earlier
fault returns after reload, existing1x control remains available; do not call it fixed.
Current1004 feature acceptance pending native Pencil test.

## .1003 — explicit render-resolution diagnostic; .1002 PASS protected — 28 October 2026

User requests further attempts after model change. Implement controlled1x versus
normal DPR through ORIGINAL viewport-sizing owner; default remains automatic capped2.
File -> UI Debug -> Test1× render resolution toggles temporary cap1; same button
restores normal. Disabled Debug and pagehide restore automatic. No localStorage,
renderer replacement, CSS resize, model/history edits, forced canvas visibility,
synthetic resize or per-frame polling. Only original coalesced resize callback writes
backing buffer. Genuine resize/tool/mode lifecycle keeps requested cap. Disposing
sizing cancels pending frames, removes API/listeners and restores prior API identity.

Button refuses Paint, active tool/session/drag, disabled orbit controls, existing
canvas probe/refresh. Exit operation before scale change; restoration on Debug off
always works. Snapshot includes requested cap and actual backing dimensions. Compare
right-region pixels immediately after1x AND after repeating failing workflow; then
restore normal and repeat. A single recovery on either switch may merely reflect
buffer reallocation, not prove DPR dependence. Native pixel result remains pending;
this is diagnostic, not claimed permanent gizmo/menu fix. Earlier both-mode evidence
retained; no repeated Studio-versus-Facegroups diagnosis needed.

Main changes viewport-sizing import key ONLY; sizing/debug owners changed, shell/
recovery keys1003 reviewed. Existing .999 resize allocation/renderer/camera code,
.1002 unlit Facegroups, palette, modelling/UV/Paint, Multi1.0 and frozen bytes retained.
Tests execute actual scale API and debug button (busy refusal, switch/restore,
snapshot, Debug off), original viewport sizes/coalescing/pagehide/cleanup and unchanged
scene/history contracts. Validation/publication: docs/publication-1003.md.

DEVICE1003: while fault visible, finish tool -> File/UI Debug -> Test1× render
resolution. Inspect right gizmo/menu; repeat original failing workflow at1x. Restore
normal resolution and repeat. Copy report while affected. Report whether1x prevents
recurrence, both switches only recover temporarily, or neither helps. Debug off
restores normal;1x intentionally looks softer. Fill Face/Facegroup remains unshipped.

## .1002 user PASS; shared gizmo/menu audit — 28 October 2026

User PASS1002 protects uniform Facegroup colour including undersides; Studio
lighting remains separate. User requests another investigation of gizmo/menu loss.
Both Studio and Facegroups affected; do not repeat that comparison. No new runtime
fix established. Gizmo local SVG overflow:hidden moves with original196px root;
VIEW fixed external sibling under app has different ancestry. No shared application
clip or scissor call established that explains both lost surfaces. Do not remove
protected SVG clipping speculatively. Prior UV screenshot cutoff near1024 CSS /
2048 physical pixels at DPR2 suggests a resolution-dependent paint/composition
hypothesis, not proof of GPU/texture-limit/WebKit cause. Next narrow diagnostic
candidate: explicit temporary1x versus automatic2x rendering using authoritative
viewport sizing owner, preserving CSS size/model/history and restoring on exit.
Not implemented; do not claim diagnostic controls exist or a fix is ready.

Current live1002; no new runtime build in this audit.69 focused tests belong to
1002 material change, not pixel-loss proof. Fill Face/Facegroup remains requested
and unshipped. No new device test required in this audit; do not ask for repeated
hidden-gizmo reports or identical Studio/Facegroups comparison.

## .1002 — uniform Facegroup colours, including undersides — 28 October 2026

User screenshot4DED25F9 shows bottom faces nearly black in Facegroups and requests
equalized shading. Original render-modes facegroupMaterial now uses unlit
MeshBasicMaterial with vertexColors and toneMapped:false instead of lit Standard.
Every front-facing polygon displays its existing group palette colour independent
of light/normal orientation. Original FrontSide, polygon offset, backface diagnostic,
palette/list/name data, selection/brush/history, other VIEW materials and renderer
lights remain unchanged. Bottom faces can now be read while orbiting underneath.
This deliberately flattens Facegroups shading; Studio retains original depth/lighting.

Scope is only original material plus reviewed render/shell/recovery1002 pins and
release markers. No UI/composition/gizmo changes; blank VIEW/right-region recurrence
stays OPEN. .1000 feature and .1001 functional acceptance retained. Requested UV
Fill Face/Facegroup with expansion remains active but unshipped; do not claim it
was included here. Validation/publication: docs/publication-1002.md.

DEVICE1002: Facegroups -> orbit below mesh; assigned undersides show same group
colour as upper faces. Paint/erase groups, UndoRedo; list colours remain consistent.
Switch Studio -> Facegroups: Studio lighting returns, group view is evenly coloured.
Current1002 native appearance acceptance pending; right-region fault still separate.

## .1001 recurrence — blank Facegroups VIEW and right-region gizmo loss — 28 October 2026

User previously PASSed1001, now reports Facegroups VIEW blank and gizmo disappears
on right, without former bottom-right ground tonal line. Reopen native visibility
gate; retain1000 feature acceptance and1001 functional/UV-specific PASS only.
Screenshot0BC723EC-C3F4-4F53-BFD5-EA081926119F.png visibly confirms1001, Facegroups
colours, Edge mode, full top-right toolbar and empty open VIEW frame. Gizmo is
visible near centre in this screenshot; disappearance at right is user-observed,
not captured as a clipped gizmo here. No new debug report supplied.

Source explanation:999 retired screen-wide DOM multiply vignette; render-modes
shows Studio floor/lights/shadows ONLY in Studio, not Facegroups. Thus absence of
old ground line in Facegroups is not proof of recovery and cannot reliably signal
UI health.1001 only removed UV workspace isolation/containment; VIEW and gizmo
runtime unchanged. Neither finding proves root cause of blank menu/gizmo loss.

No new runtime build or speculative CSS repair in this evidence update. Current
release1001. Prioritize this recurrence before implementing requested Fill Face /
Fill Facegroup; that request remains active and unshipped. Next useful device
comparison: close VIEW, move same visible gizmo across right region, then compare
Studio versus Facegroups without reload/app-switch/recovery. Do not demand another
identical hidden-gizmo dump or treat healthy DOM/hits as pixel proof.

## .1001 — UV Editor plain composition; .1000 feature PASS — 27 October 2026

User explicitly PASSes .1000 features, but reports right-side loss after entering
UV Editor. Protect .1000 UV validation/Studio handoff/Facegroup unwrap behavior;
do not interpret feature PASS as native visibility acceptance.

IMG_8342.png shows editor chrome cut off near screen x1024 CSS (image x2048),
including partial Checker label, right editor surface and top-right toolbar.
Underlying 3D floor remains visible at right. Report 09:41:45Z: uv-tools session,
uvchecker/Object, workspace visible at8/68/1350/793 under app; toolbar bounds/hits
healthy, VIEW closed/hidden, atmosphere absent, gizmo intentionally hidden.
Canvas2732x1652/DPR2. No evidence of missing DOM, stale release or UV topology loss.
Hide3D button clicks in supplied log do not establish an observed diagnostic result.

Source audit found UV entry still reintroduced old .952 isolation on viewport and
workspace, plus isolation/paint containment on UV canvas wrapper. This survived .999's
plain startup baseline. Remove those CSS declarations and active :has viewport rule
ONLY in original uv-workspace. Retain sibling root, z9 under header10, fixed insets,
scrolling, overflow clipping, original controls/canvas identity, sizing and gestures.
Mesh Health changes child cache key only; shell parent/recovery keys1001 reviewed.
No renderer, model/history/UV/paint algorithms, main999/styles999, Multi1.0 or frozen
changes. This closes a verified baseline mismatch, NOT proven WebKit root cause or
permanent right-region repair. Native visibility gate stays OPEN until device feedback.

Existing .952 CSS contract now protects plain UV composition, retaining all original
header/exit/geometry/scroll bounds and lifecycle/navigation/history assertions.
Validation/publication results: docs/publication-1001.md. Standing push/publish
approval applies. Next prioritize native UV-entry result before further rendering
changes; do not repeat blur/vignette/closed-menu hypotheses already disproved.

DEVICE1001: fresh load -> UV Editor, inspect full right border/Checker/Image/top
buttons; Back to3D and reopen several times without app-switch/recovery. Pan/pinch,
select/Pencil-move an island, UndoRedo. Back to3D -> VIEW Studio/Facegroups -> UV
Editor; inspect right side again. .1000 accepted workflow stays protected.

## .1000 — UV Paint handoff and Facegroups → UV Seams — 27 October 2026

User says “PASS 999 so far”. Record PROVISIONAL .999 PASS and protect the exact
main/styles/retired-atmosphere startup baseline. This is not an unlimited native
visibility acceptance. User explicitly requests the next UV/Facegroups workflow.

UV PAINT now uses the existing paintTargetKey validator before entering Paint.
Missing/stale/incompatible UVs open the ORIGINAL UV session through __boxlabUVTools,
with “Valid UVs required for UV Paint” at the TOP. No UV/paint/history is authored
by the redirect. Valid targets in Facegroups view switch through the existing Studio
button, stopping the original Facegroup stroke/dock owners, before Paint opens.
Finished UV-tools sessions hand off directly to bottom UV PAINT; busy unwraps require
Finish/Cancel first. Existing other-tool protections remain intact.

UV menu adds “Facegroups → UV Seams”, orbitable orange boundary preview, explicit
“Confirm UV Unwrap”, elapsed timer and Cancel. Preview has no history or UV edits,
no raw pointer consumer and no control disabling. Connected equal-name regions form
charts, including an unassigned region; disconnected regions form separate islands.
Native mesh boundary and differing-group edges delimit patches. Original geometry,
groups, names, palette and selection are retained. Planar patches keep exact shapes;
curved disk patches use bounded positive-weight harmonic flattening with periodic
frame yields. Original UV preview triangulation validates every flattened face;
original density, packing, native UV commit, project transport and ONE history
checkpoint remain authoritative. Completion selects existing UV Checker and keeps
orange patch boundaries visible in 3D while the UV session stays open. Closing,
changing target, entering UV Editor or cancelling releases the owned seam overlay.

Honest limits: 4096 faces / 20,000 corners; plain independent unlocked Base mesh,
SubD/Mirror off, no stored paint. Closed groups, holes/handles, pinches, inconsistent
winding, non-manifold edges, solver failure/work overflow refuse without mutation
and ask for additional Facegroup boundaries. Never silently insert cuts within a
group. Curved patches can stretch; existing flat atlas remains available.

Testing: new UV projection/packing/curved chart/resource/SaveOpen checks; real Paint
entry and UV session handoff; timed confirm/cancel/target-change and overlay cleanup.
Repaired old test harnesses for original Sweep UV-release hook and dynamically loaded
Facegroup dock cache owner; no Sweep or dock runtime edits. Final full-suite and live
publication results: docs/publication-1000.md. No native iPad feature PASS inferred.
Standing push/publish authorization continues. .996 File and .994 palette protected.

DEVICE1000: (1) no-UV object → UV PAINT → original UV menu + top reminder;
(2) valid UV object in Facegroups → UV PAINT → Studio + paint;
(3) UV → Facegroups → UV Seams → orbit/check → Confirm UV Unwrap → timer → checker
and orange boundaries; (4) Undo/Redo and Save/Open retain UVs/groups; Cancel creates
no UV/history edits. Also check .999 initial/right viewport remains healthy.
Current build .1000; feature acceptance pending device test.

## .999 — rebuild initial viewport baseline; .998 FAIL — 27 October 2026

User explicitly FAILs .998: right-side viewport patch exists immediately after
refresh, VIEW initially works, then selecting Facegroups leaves it blank. Screenshot
715C468D-4F44-4AF8-8E86-5F1B083F9DFC.png shows the bottom/right tonal boundary before
VIEW opens. Do not repeat menu-only frame/scroller changes or infer success from
healthy DOM bounds. .997/.998 are not complete visibility repairs.

Rebuild the existing initial presentation path: remove .967 CSS paint containment,
canvas/wrapper/header isolation and opacity-layer requests; retain original z-order.
Retire the full-viewport HTML multiply vignette and its mode opacity animation;
existing Studio WebGL lights, ground and shadows remain authoritative. The original
main renderer now uses one atomic setDrawingBufferSize for actual dimensions/DPR
changes, without initial setPixelRatio followed by size reset, and does not rewrite
canvas backing dimensions on same-size startup/visibility/session callbacks.
No second renderer, canvas recreation, forced hide/show or refresh loop. No menu,
Facegroups modelling/colour, geometry, history, gesture or frozen Multi changes.
The vignette is intentionally removed: a slightly less dark edge is expected.

Validation: 20 focused startup/sizing/composition/VIEW/release checks PASS; syntax
and whitespace clean. Broader and publication results: docs/publication-999.md.
No native pixel proof is claimed. .999 is a baseline retest, not an accepted fix.
Keep feature work paused until initial refresh and Facegroups visibility are stable.
Standing user authorization to commit/push/publish remains in force.

DEVICE999, in order: refresh and inspect bottom/right BEFORE opening VIEW; open
Studio VIEW; select Facegroups, scroll and reopen VIEW; return Studio; select/move
near the right edge and inspect gizmo; verify orbit/pan/pinch and Undo/Redo. Report
which earliest stage fails. Current build .999; readiness = device retest pending.

## .998 — Facegroups transition repair, native acceptance pending — 27 October 2026

User clarified: VIEW works in Studio, then becomes empty when Facegroups is selected.
.997 is partial Studio success, not overall VIEW acceptance. Facegroups adds enough
content to overflow the menu (reported scrollHeight 980 versus clientHeight 810).
.998 separates the fixed external frame from a bounded normal-flow inner scroller,
retaining original controls, IDs, delegation, native open owner and Clean View section.
The fixed frame no longer owns touch overflow. Inner scroll position survives closing.
The right-side gizmo patch remains OPEN; no visible-gizmo capture proves its cause.
Protected: accepted .996 File menu and .994 palette, original Multi and gestures.
Validation: focused VIEW/layout/release/facegroup/File tests; native device test still
required: open Studio VIEW, switch Facegroups, scroll to bottom, close/reopen, return

## Beta 3 release gate

- [x] Complete the hands-on checks in `BETA3_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` on iPad Safari before freezing `/beta-3/`
- [x] Do not add new modelling features during the release-candidate cycle
- [x] Fix only reproducible release-blocking regressions
- [ ] Confirm the frozen Beta 3 URL and live main URL both smoke-test successfully after Pages deployment

# BoxLab Regression Test Checklist

This checklist is the persistent regression contract for BoxLab.

Run the sections relevant to a change. Expand this file when a new stable workflow becomes worth protecting.

## Core navigation

- [ ] Safari/iPad native text or element selection never washes the BoxLab modelling UI blue during ordinary touch/Pencil actions
- [ ] native long-press callout/drag selection is suppressed on BoxLab chrome and viewport
- [ ] input / textarea / select / contenteditable controls retain normal text/value interaction
- [ ] one-finger orbit works
- [ ] after finger-selecting another object, one-finger orbit remains orbit (not pan) and pinch zoom still works
- [ ] two-finger pan works
- [ ] pinch zoom works
- [ ] two-finger tap Undo works
- [ ] three-finger tap Redo works
- [ ] orbit pivot does not jump
- [ ] navigation does not unexpectedly clear persistent selections
- [ ] while any Tool Session is active, Active Tools cannot collapse from viewport interaction; Apply/Cancel/end-session restores normal drawer behaviour
- [ ] Solidify: Object launch opens exclusive Tool Session; live Thickness/direct viewport drag work; Cancel leaves source unchanged; Apply creates the same closed solid as before
- [ ] Shell: selected Face opening launch opens exclusive Tool Session; Pencil Thickness works; Cancel leaves solid unchanged; Apply creates the same hollow solid/opening as before
- [ ] Revolve Profile: new plane remains positionable before editing; moving/snapping or launcher opens exclusive Tool Session; Pencil profile editing, Segments 3–64 and Apply remain unchanged
- [ ] after Array END-copy drag / Apply / Cancel, free Vertex Move immediately works again and no stale pointer capture remains
- [ ] Vertex mode: selected vertex can Move / Scale / Rotate; Vertex Pick Assist still handles ordinary taps when no transform is armed

## Selection

- [ ] Vertex selection works
- [ ] Edge selection works
- [ ] Face selection works
- [ ] Face multi-select works immediately after a fresh app load, without requiring a mode change first
- [ ] returning to Face/Edge/Vertex from another selection mode restores intended additive component multi-selection
- [ ] Object selection works
- [ ] Visible / Through selection-depth controls work
- [ ] Loop selection works
- [ ] Ring selection works
- [ ] Boundary selection works
- [ ] Grow / Shrink / Connected selection works where applicable
- [ ] Angle / Normal selection works where applicable
- [ ] selection indicators remain usable while zooming
- [ ] navigation preserves the intended selection

## Object / Multi

- [ ] ordinary Duplicate stays independent and does not share geometry
- [ ] Linked Duplicate creates a second editable object that shares source geometry but keeps independent Object-mode placement
- [ ] moving / rotating / scaling one linked instance in Object mode does not move the others
- [ ] component edits on one linked instance propagate to all linked peers in their own placements
- [ ] Make Unique detaches only the active linked instance; later edits no longer propagate between it and the former link group
- [ ] Linked Duplicate / Make Unique survive Object-mode Undo/Redo with link metadata intact
- [ ] with Object Multi active, Linked Duplicate operates on every selected editable object and selects the newly created linked set
- [ ] Multi Linked Duplicate skips Reference guides and preserves duplicated group relationships / relative arrangement
- [ ] with Object Multi active, Make Unique detaches all selected linked objects in one history step
- [ ] ordinary Multi Duplicate remains independent and does not silently become linked
- [ ] Join produces a unique combined result even if one input was linked
- [ ] object creation works
- [ ] switching active object works
- [ ] duplicate works and uses padded numbering (01, 02, 03…) instead of appending copy
- [ ] duplicating an already-numbered sibling continues the same numbering family rather than nesting another suffix
- [ ] linked and Multi duplicate naming follows the same numbered object-name rule
- [ ] rename works
- [ ] Object Rename opens the BoxLab rename field already focused with the current text selected for immediate typing
- [ ] Object footer is compact Add / Duplicate / More, while Rename / Delete / Linked Duplicate / Make Unique remain available and correctly enabled inside More
- [ ] delete works
- [ ] each object-row More menu includes Delete Object and deletes that specific object with one Undo step
- [ ] in Object mode, Delete and Backspace trigger the authoritative Delete action for the current single/Multi/Group selection
- [ ] Delete / Backspace do nothing while typing in Rename or another editable field
- [ ] Boolean results use compact B numbering (B1, B2, B3…) from the active/base object name instead of concatenating operand names
- [ ] Join works
- [ ] multi-object selection/management works
- [ ] Object Selection toolbar stays in a compact five-button strip with readable status text
- [ ] grouped Outliner hierarchy preserves group membership through Object Undo/Redo
- [ ] custom group names survive scene Undo/Redo and group rename is one Undo step
- [ ] Group Rename immediately updates the visible Group header and opens focused with the current name selected
- [ ] selecting one complete group enables the normal Rename button as Rename Group
- [ ] selected group header is visibly distinct and its name acts as the primary group selection target
- [ ] selecting a whole Group promotes the hidden active/primary object into that Group if the previous active object was outside it
- [ ] a whole selected Group renders amber as one viewport selection state
- [ ] a whole selected Group moves together on iPad/Pencil even when every member is already selected in the hierarchy
- [ ] Group context survives the object-origin selection wrapper so viewport tint and transform routing agree
- [ ] while a whole Group is selected, the active member's individual cage/verts are suppressed and no outside object remains visually highlighted
- [ ] Group Selection immediately creates the visible hierarchy row; it must not merely stamp per-object group IDs/tags
- [ ] compact Group tree keeps Group Selection contextual: the creation control is hidden unless 2+ groupable objects are selected
- [ ] compact Group header uses disclosure + name + visibility + More; Lock / Rename / Ungroup live inside More without expanding drawer height unnecessarily
- [ ] compact object rows use Name + SubD + Visibility + More; Lock / Solo / Delete remain available inside More
- [ ] per-object SubD button reflects object.settings.subd and updates inactive-object rendering without changing active object
- [ ] active-object SubD button stays synchronized with the existing Modifiers > SubD Preview checkbox
- [ ] Reference objects cannot enable SubD from the Outliner
- [ ] Object / Group / footer More popovers are explicitly anchored above their trigger and remain visible above the drawer's lower edge
- [ ] Group More menu Rename/Ungroup works while the normal Rename Group pathway remains available
- [ ] exactly two selected objects show amber/blue viewport tint (active/primary amber, second blue) while the Outliner remains neutral unless Boolean-specific UI is in use
- [ ] group visibility and lock each Undo/Redo as one Object scene-history step
- [ ] group header direct Ungroup works without breaking normal Group Selection / Multi behavior
- [ ] collapsed/expanded group state survives scene Undo/Redo when the group still exists
- [ ] removed groups do not leak stale names/collapse state into later groups that reuse an ID
- [ ] object transforms do not regress
- [ ] reference objects remain protected from destructive editing
- [ ] Reference imports are permanently read-only guides: single, Multi and Group lock controls cannot unlock them
- [ ] Reference visibility / solo still work and visible Reference geometry remains eligible for cross-object snapping
- [ ] duplicating or restoring a Reference through scene Undo/Redo must preserve kind=reference and locked=true

## Component alignment

- [ ] existing Make Planar remains available for a selected Face
- [ ] Align X enters anchor-pick mode, then aligns the other selected component vertices to the picked anchor X coordinate
- [ ] Align Y enters anchor-pick mode, then aligns the other selected component vertices to the picked anchor Y coordinate
- [ ] Align Z enters anchor-pick mode, then aligns the other selected component vertices to the picked anchor Z coordinate
- [ ] picked Align anchor stays fixed
- [ ] picked Align anchor gets the amber Boolean-style reference cue
- [ ] component Align preserves the current component selection
- [ ] component Align commits as one Undo step
- [ ] component Align is hidden in Object mode

## Precision snapping

- [ ] component Move displays live ΔX / ΔY / ΔZ while dragging
- [ ] snapped component Move keeps numeric delta readback visible alongside the snap target label
- [ ] Geometry-enabled component Move can snap selected vertices to visible geometry on other objects
- [ ] free component Move can align an edge/face/multi-component centre to another-object snap target
- [ ] axis-constrained component Move changes only the constrained coordinate when snapping cross-object
- [ ] target object remains unchanged during component Move snapping
- [ ] hidden/solo-excluded objects do not contribute component Move snap targets

## Vertex tools

- [ ] Add Vertex can snap to visible geometry on other objects without modifying the target object
- [ ] cross-object snapping prefers target vertices, then midpoints, then generic edge positions
- [ ] hidden/solo-excluded objects do not contribute snap targets
- [ ] Add Vertex works
- [ ] Build Edge works
- [ ] arming Build Edge fully disarms Add Vertex; Add must not light back up after the Build Edge click
- [ ] Vertex Active Tools keep the fixed order Bevel / Add / Build Edge / Slide / Create Face / Circle without jumping during selection renders
- [ ] Vertex Slide works
- [ ] Vertex Bevel works
- [ ] multi-vertex bevel works where supported
- [ ] Vertex Join works
- [ ] Weld works
- [ ] Delete Vertex works safely

## Circle / regularize

- [ ] Circle appears in contextual Vertex / Edge / Face Active Tools, not in Selection
- [ ] Vertex Circle sits in the Slide / Create Face row as the third button
- [ ] Edge Circle sits immediately after Delete in the bottom Topology row
- [ ] Face Circle sits beside Poke Faces in the same row
- [ ] no old standalone bottom Circle row remains
- [ ] Circle is available for a simple closed selected Vertex/Edge loop or exactly one selected Face boundary
- [ ] Circle preserves the selected loop centre and working plane
- [ ] Circle regularizes existing loop vertices to one radius with even angular spacing
- [ ] Circle does n…178915 tokens truncated…history, with explicit
Object UV Clear paint guidance. Original unsupported target/history/finite/collapse/
Pack guards retained. No general curved unwrap, cube-net unfolding, optimal packing,
arbitrary overlap repair or paint resampling. Native source:boxlab corner schema,
geometry, project/history/export owners remain unchanged. Canonical Box is transient
validation/alignment only, not a replacement live UV mapping or parallel kernel.

stitch/cut separately. Move/rotate/scale an island before stitching; same flat patch

Next actual955 device feedback before expanding stitch/general unwrap; preserve

## .956 — bounded angle-based Auto atlas; 4096-face limit — 24 October 2026 (Brisbane)

User requests automatic connected-face stitching during atlas generation, a practical
face limit, bounded runtime, then suggests edge angle. Also asks whether named
.boxlab saves can overwrite existing Downloads files. No955 device PASS inferred;
953 Cut UVs/954 picking/952 editor acceptance remain protected.

Audit main393978b3: Coplanar atlas already joins flat charts through original
inspector adjacency + Box projection, but was labelled secondary and capped128faces;
Pack/density also128 with fixed2% gaps, and global plane seed search was quadratic.
Reuse SAME existing button/owner as primary Auto atlas (before explicit Face atlas),
add join angle0–30°/default15. API createCoplanarAtlasUV sixth optional angle defaults0,
preserving accepted flat outputs and manual955 plane grouping.0° = exact prior
coplanar policy. Positive angle requires BOTH adjacent average face-normal angle
and a fixed seed-normal cone within cutoff, opposite manifold edge directions and
EXACT original Box UV endpoints. No drift along curved chains, coordinate welding,
second triangulator/adjacency/history owner or calls to manual Stitch in a loop.

This is bounded projected-chart grouping, not conformal unwrap/relaxation or arbitrary
cube-net unfolding. Different Box directions remain seams; higher angle may stretch.
Warped faces stay separate at0°, may join in angle mode if original950 triangle/area
validation succeeds. No source polygons/positions/groups or persistent schema changes.
Original private Box → grouped density → Pack → ONE native commit retained. All paint
channels still require explicit Clear paint; unsupported/stale/history/work refusal
atomic. Explicit Face atlas retains one island per face and exact small outputs.

Atlas face cap4096 (32×128), original20K face-corner budget retained. Shared Pack all
and Equalize density support4096 islands so large atlas remains editable. Manual955
Stitch still has its independent conservative128-face scope. Original <=128-island
packing gap2% and exact output retained; larger layouts use gap .2/ceil(sqrt(count)),
outer margin2%, SAME deterministic common-scale grid search (at most4096 columns).
At4096 charts this is~3.2px gap on1024 maps; no larger texture resolution claimed.

Same plane/cone grouping owner now indexes seed buckets for >128faces: max81 bucket
lookups/64 seed candidates per face (27 lookups for positive angle), then ORIGINAL
strict seed tests. Overloaded buckets conservatively leave extra charts separate.
Small fixed-plane output path unchanged; no iterative stitching/relaxation/optimal
packer. Host smoke4096-face original Add Plane:15° Auto34.6ms,0°44.4ms,Face16.7ms;
these are single local CPU observations, NOT iPad latency or a timing promise.

Seven new integrations cover4096-face Auto/Face, exact joins/geometry/peer ownership/
repeat/one checkpoint; large Pack/density and reduced wasted UV area; warped fallback/
disconnected planes; limits/refusals; actual1024-face history/paint/SaveOpen/GLB;
primary existing UI/angle forwarding; exact same requested download filename twice;
and shallow/sharp angle thresholds, fixed-cone drift and256-face fast path. Existing
128-boundary refusal fixtures893/895/949/951/953 moved to4097 without dropping any
atomicity assertion; prior128 success tests retained.951 panel fixture explicitly0°.
Original other runtime algorithms retained; full and publication proof follows.

Save audit: projectFileName/exportBasicProject already request EXACT chosen name,
no appended counter. Safari/iOS Downloads collision naming is outside this download
API. Current MDN primary compatibility data records showSaveFilePicker unsupported
in Safari/iOS; Chrome's API documentation explicitly says anchor-download fallback
cannot overwrite. No risky replacement/hidden internal save/new filesystem feature
added. Existing Save/Open/codec unchanged; regression proves two identical requested

DEVICE956: previously over128-face unpainted mesh → Object UV → Auto atlas15°;
check time and chart count. Compare0°/15° on shallow bends, sharper corners retain
seams; greater angles may stretch. UV Editor/Pack/UndoRedo; Paint and SaveOpen result.
New limits4096faces/20Kcorners, not unlimited. Next follow real iPad quality/latency
feedback before broadening unwrap;955 manual Stitch device gate remains separate.

## User product direction — Paint, facegroups and graphical UI — 24 October 2026

User explicitly says these are FUTURE GUIDELINES, not immediate requests to implement
all of them in956. Preserve current atlas build scope. Future direction:
- Paint facegroups directly on the mesh: assign existing mesh.faceGroups per polygon,
  not RGB texture pixels. Existing clone/history/project/OBJ/NOM group owners stay
  authoritative. Reuse surface face picking/Pencil/navigation; a UV-free group-target
  needs deliberate target validation rather than pretending current UV painter already
  supports it. One scene checkpoint per stroke; no parallel mesh/group/history kernel.
- Bring production Paint into mainstream app access; current viewport-paint.js launcher
  is in File. Reconnect original painter/session, not a second painting implementation.
- Contextual paint radial for brushes and layers/masks, retaining original controls/
  action owners and the accepted left dock until deliberately migrated and tested.
- More graphical UI: consistent function icons with SMALL VISIBLE text captions below,
  inspired by user's uploaded Nomad Sculpt screenshot0D6C6D33-1097-419E-AC66-52B94B18D841.
  Keep readable labels/accessibility/touch targets; coherent icon family and active state.
  Stage changes in small reviewed surfaces; retain accepted radial locations, gestures,
  Focus, history and modeller behavior. No wholesale reskin automatically authorized
  as the next untested change. These directions remain in roadmap after atlas feedback.

Audit: mesh.js stores string/null faceGroups and preserves them on clone; original
facegroup-colours-core displays them. Preview already has source-face triangle mapping.
956 does not ship facegroup brushes, new Paint entry, paint radial or icon redesign.

.956 final local Node24.19.0 full regression: **2796 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 skipped**
(101.5s), original2789 plus seven new atlas/angle/save-name checks. Focused atlas949/

## .957 — variable-size shelf packing; .956 PASS — 24 October 2026

User .956 PASS /nextbuild protects angle Auto atlas and larger limits. Audit main
82ddf0de: packedLayout allocates identical cells using largest chart bounds; original
UV workspace still disabled Pack/density above128 despite4096-capable owner.
Extend SAME packedLayout with height/width/ID sorted next-fit shelves and24 bounded
common-scale trials. Choose only if common scale strictly improves over original
grid; equal-sized charts retain original grid. No chart rotation, shape nesting,
relaxation, seam changes or optimal-packing claim. Source geometry and original
UV/history/paint refusal/numeric-collapse validation retained. All callers (Auto/
Face atlas, Pack, Cut/Stitch repack) reuse original owner. Workspace Pack/density
now enabled through4096 islands. Margin and count-dependent gaps unchanged.
New tests verify mixed-size coverage, common relative density, separation, bounds,
determinism, equal-size fallback and actual workspace129/4096/4097 control gating.

before UV repacking. Bigger chart bounding boxes do not guarantee tight concave nesting.
Next follow actual packing quality/device timing before broader unwrap or UI changes.

## .958 — UV popup clipping containment — 24 October 2026

User screenshot FA9BB69D on957 shows right toolbar and bottom status disappearing
at the SAME vertical boundary while UV TOOLS popup is open, before UV Workspace.
Not stale shell; not evidence against957 packing. No957 device PASS inferred.
Audit shared tool-session-ui begin: UV tools uses transformed scrolling shared dock.
Existing952 Workspace sibling fix does not apply to this preceding popup.
Narrow mitigation: original UV-tools host uses left/right8px + auto margins instead
of translateX centring, local isolation and layout/paint containment. Original nodes,
listeners, wide body/actions, history and all UV algorithms unchanged. Clear these
UV-only styles before the next dock (including left Paint); ordinary tools keep
shared placement. No new editor, pointer listener, resize polling or z-index escalation.
Exact iPad/WebKit compositor failure is NOT reproduced here; this is a targeted
containment repair requiring device acceptance, not a proven browser-engine diagnosis.
New test executes original begin for UV→Paint→ordinary tool and verifies scoped clip,
transform-free UV placement and style cleanup. Release contract/cache keys reviewed958;
main954/picker954/Multi1.0/frozen and957 packing/workspace unchanged.
DEVICE958: repeat Object→UV and Close, watch full top-right toolbar/status; Auto atlas,
Open UV Editor→Back to3D, then Paint and another tool to check popup positions.
Next actual958 iPad clipping retest before further unrelated development.

## .959 — reconnect production Paint in Object radial; .958 PASS — 24 October 2026

User958 PASS /nextbuild protects UV-popup/header/status clipping repair and style
cleanup across UV→Paint→ordinary tools. Prior pending958 device notes superseded.
Audit main85544a7e: original object-radial-session already maps UV Paint to original
viewportPaintBtn/uv-paint/__boxlabViewportPaint, but total-gizmo ring omitted button.
Add UV Paint at outer45° radius230; every existing sector stays in place. Original
adapter launches SAME production painter, owns cancellation/completion/gizmo hide;
existing File launcher retained. Painter opens left dock and enforces original one
active independent UV object/paint target guards. No new brush/layer/history/input
owner, no painter changes or icon overhaul. Original left Paint exception retained.
Extend original711 inventory/launch/close/spacing fixture with UV Paint; left8px
expectation includes original Paint dock, all old assertions and positions retained.
Local full2800PASS/0FAIL/0skip (95.99s); focused19PASS, final radial14PASS.
No assertions removed. Publication evidence follows. Only runtime functionality: one radial
button; shell/recovery/gizmo cache pin959 and reviewed asset contract. Session958,
main954/picker954/Multi1.0/UV957/packing/frozen unchanged.
DEVICE959: select one UV object → Object radial → UV Paint (outer upper-right);
Pencil paint, fingers orbit/pan/pinch, UndoRedo stays in Paint; Done→radial→reopen
same layers. Try UV popup→close→Paint and Paint→Done→another tool. SaveOpen retains

## .960 — captioned brush-tool radial in Paint dock; .959 PASS — 24 October 2026

User959 PASS /nextbuild protects original Object radial UV Paint access and accepted
958 clipping fix. Audit current099f117d: painter's paint-action select owns tool
settings/change cancellation, Brush/Fill/Eraser/Smudge/Blur already implemented.
Replace visible select with native details Brush tools picker in SAME Paint dock;
original select remains hidden as settings/event owner. Five66×52px buttons on a
220px radial, SVG function icons and visible captions; selected aria-pressed highlight
and collapsed current-tool caption. Each click checks original active/disabled gate,
sets original select and dispatches SAME change event (clear staged image/cancel live
stroke/sync controls). Picker closes on choice and session end. AO disabled selection
is mirrored. No new viewport input, brush raster/history/paint resource or layer owner.
Accepted left dock/footer/layers/settings/gesture/tool positions retained. No layer
radial, facegroups or broad reskin in960; staged graphical UI only on these5 tools.
Two actual production UI integrations: all5 tools/caption/selection/blur controls/
no history and disabled refusal; live Pencil stroke→radial switch cancels original
contact while retaining committed paint/history and navigation. Initial new fixture
read aria-pressed from property instead of existing attributes map; corrected test

## .961 — bound hidden gizmo projection and SVG compositor surface; .960 radial PASS

24 October2026. User960 PASS for brush radial; separately reports giant red/green
lines after Paint Done and recurring right-side UI disappearance following UV tools/
map views, changing as gizmo/object orbits across screen. Prior958 clipping PASS is
historical; recurrence is OPEN and not dismissed by prior PASS or Node results.
Reviewed uploaded1EC44980 screenshot and9.7s ScreenRecording17-11-35 frames1s/7s.
Video shows live model/gizmo while header/object UI disappears. Exact iPad compositor
fault remains unreproduced locally; do not claim a proven WebKit engine diagnosis.
Audit current13a0b4a9: total-gizmo sync sets root.hidden during Paint but still calls
syncAxisVisuals. projectedRingPath uses SIZE196/max(1,hiddenRect.width0): hidden
projection magnifies ring coordinates196×; root drop-shadow filter and overflowing
main SVG allow enormous paint/filter bounds. Both failures plausibly share this
unbounded presentation surface, unlike previous popup-only mitigation.
Repair SAME gizmo owner: no axis update while hidden; projectedRingPath returns empty
for hidden/zero/nonfinite dimensions or any nonfinite/out-of-local196×196 ring point.
Degenerate rings clear both visible and hit paths through existing sync owner;
hidden gizmos skip updates and recompute normally when shown.
Remove root drop-shadow filter; bound only direct main SVG overflow. External radial
sectors/corner shortcuts remain outside main SVG and keep original placement/input.
No transform geometry, gesture, UV/paint/history/render kernel or Multi1.0 changes.
959 radial/960 brush controls and958 popup containment unchanged. This targets the
actual hidden sizing defect and constrains rendering; iPad retest is still required.
Two tests execute original ring functions with realThree perspective camera: normal
XYZ paths, hidden→zero→restore exact recovery, finite local coordinates, invalid
projection refusal; hidden sync guard/main SVG/filter scope and retained external
Paint button/shortcut contracts. Focused7PASS; local full2804PASS/0FAIL/0skip (104.73s). Publication evidence follows.
DEVICE961: Paint→Done on same model; no giant coloured lines. Repeat UV tools→UV
Editor→Back/Close; orbit model/gizmo into right side and watch entire toolbar/Object
Browser/status remain visible. Move/Rotate/Scale and radial tools still usable;
Paint/UndoRedo and finger navigation preserved. Next actual961 rendering feedback
before unrelated features. If recurrence persists, keep independent clipping report
open and inspect other filtered/overflowing layers; do not infer acceptance.

## Paint UI direction clarified by user — 24 October2026

User says960 dock-contained radial misunderstood intent. Desired SAME floating
viewport radial theme as Vertex/Edge/Face/Object, with Paint context. Choose brush:
radial disappears; compact, correctly sized contextual settings at TOP CENTRE;
remaining viewport clear for painting. Hold EMPTY BACKGROUND to reopen Paint radial,
choose Blur/etc, then radial disappears and contextual top panel changes. Layers,
masks and image placement should open contextual panels only when requested.
Existing left all-controls dock is transitional, not desired final Paint interface.
User explicitly defers possible bottom-left Paint mode button alongside selection.
Do not silently replace this request with another radial embedded in a dock.
Stage migration using current painter/action/history/layer owners and shared panel
position/compact layout; no new brush engine. Paint-context background hold must
belong to single existing gesture owner and override modelling invert ONLY while
painting; fingers still orbit/pan/pinch, Pencil paints, UndoRedo stays in Paint.
Do not open a radial from a surface paint stroke or navigation; cancel pending hold
on movement/multitouch. Scope regular modelling radial/gesture owners unchanged.
This is documented direction;961 fixes rendering only and does not ship this UI.

## .962 — startup/lifecycle viewport sizing; .961 rendering FAIL — 24 October2026

User961 FAIL: right-side UI broken immediately after refresh; portrait→landscape
restores it. Do NOT mark961 rendering fixed from2804 automated passes.960 brush
radial acceptance is separate; user's clarified floating viewport Paint radial with
compact TOP contextual settings remains recorded and is NOT implemented in962.
Audit main5fb4a4fa: renderer resize runs once at startup and on window.resize only,
DPR is set once. Later layout/container/visual viewport changes have no sizing owner.
Original main resize now accepts measured width/height/cappedDPR and updates SAME
renderer/camera/selection display. New small viewport-sizing scheduler coalesces
ResizeObserver, window resize/orientation/pageshow, visualViewport resize and semantic
tool-session transitions into one frame. Startup has an additional settling frame.
Unchanged observer dimensions no-op; lifecycle transitions request one same-size
canvas repaint. Zero sizes defer, DPR is capped2, no per-frame polling/synthetic
resize events/temporary1px jiggle/forcedorientation/second renderer or input owner.
This follows rotation's resize/repaint path but exact iPad compositor fault remains
unreproduced;962 is a targeted lifecycle repair requiring device feedback.
Main changes ONLY helper import, resize function and binding; internal main stamp
retained. Main loader962 intentional.961 gizmo bounds retained; UV/paint/geometry/
history, protectedMulti1.0 and frozen releases unchanged. Reviewed asset contract
adds exact main→viewport-sizing import; shell/recovery/main pins962.
Three integrations: original main resize callback preserves renderer/camera/position;
startup/settled layout/container-only resize/DPR/coalescing/no
polling; same-size pageshow/session/orientation repaint/zero-size/cleanup. Focused7PASS.
Full/publication evidence follows. Prior961 proof and clarified Paint direction are
included in this handoff, superseded by explicit961 FAIL above.
DEVICE962: refresh in LANDSCAPE without rotation; inspect whole right toolbar/Object
Browser/status. UV tools→Editor→Back/Close, orbit to both sides. Paint→Done checks
lines independently, then Move/Rotate/Scale and UndoRedo. Report if rotation is still
needed; do not infer device PASS from tests. Defer Paint layout migration until stable.

.962 targeted validation30PASS/0FAIL/0skip (~1.1s): production sizing scheduler+
main resize, release contract, original961 ring guards,954 picking,952 UV workspace,
900 actual Paint/core and960 brush radial. Syntax checks main/helper pass. Prior full
run was interrupted and temporary log unavailable; no full962 count claimed.

suite for narrow changes; run relevant checks and verify deployment, report hosted
full-suite status accurately. GitHub still runs full regression automatically.

redesign remains documented direction, not shipped. No device962 PASS inferred.


## .963 — floating Paint radial and contextual controls; .962 PASS — 24 October 2026

User confirms .962 PASS; protect fresh-landscape viewport sizing, UV workspace return,
orbit visibility and Paint Done rendering. Ship the clarified Paint interaction using
the existing viewport painter and original main background-hold owner. The floating
radial offers Brush/Fill/Eraser/Smudge/Blur plus Layers/Mask/Image/AO/Texture pages.
Choosing an item closes the radial; the original painter controls appear in a compact
top-centre contextual panel. Holding empty background reopens the Paint radial. Pencil
strokes, finger navigation, Undo/Redo, resource, AO and image placement continue through
original owners. Paint hold is allowed only while idle (no stroke/image/AO preview); the
original hold cancels on movement, multitouch, pointer cancel or session change.
Paint settings use the shared panel position owner with a compact option; other popup
layouts remain unchanged. iPad tactile acceptance remains pending.

- Paint radial: tool and contextual-page choices close the floating radial; idle empty-background hold reopens it; movement, painting contact, navigation and multitouch do not reopen it.


## .964 — left side compact Paint settings; user direction — 25 October 2026

User requests Paint contextual popups at LEFT because top-centre settings obstruct the viewport. Keep the floating radial and existing painter/control owners from .963. Reuse shared position owner with compact layout; set Paint host 8px from left/top, width capped at320px, viewport-height scroll. Reduce gaps modestly while preserving readable labels and minimum tap heights. Other tool popups retain top-centre placement. DEVICE964: Brush/Blur left placement, spacing, radial hold/reopen, Pencil, finger navigation, UndoRedo, contextual pages and Done. Next: obtain iPad acceptance of radial + left popup before more controls; then prioritize facegroup painting.

- Paint contextual panels remain narrow, scrollable and on the left; spacing stays comfortable and radial hold flow works.


## .965 — Paint workflow and UI evidence — 25 October 2026

User .964 PASS accepts LEFT compact Paint popup, but recurring inactive right-side UI
remains OPEN. Do not infer rendering repaired. Current requested UI: bottom UV PAINT
beside SELECT; native UV validation before entry; original Object radial Paint sector
removed. File keeps no duplicate button once bottom bar is ready. Layers now always
visible at top, selected contextual settings below. Radial choices stay visible until
Pencil begins a valid surface stroke/image gesture; browsing choices adds no history.
Repeated Paint entry reopens tools; empty background hold reuses main's single timer
with explicit Paint background policy, bypassing modelling hit proxies. Done exits;
Escape cancels live contact without leaving Paint; competing tool launch is refused.
Invalid/deleted geometry may still close for resource safety.

Smudge audit found bounded 8M-work guard threw and cancelled valid stroke pixels.
Guard now pauses additional dabs at cap and exposes a lift-to-keep status; lifting
commits the valid prefix normally. Cancellation/checkpoint refusal still restore.
No unbounded raster work or changed cap. Map size replaces ambiguous Texture caption:
colour resolution/legacy512-to1024 enlargement, not a brush.

File → UI Debug extends original opt-in gesture debug: bounded100 events, right-side
hit-test stacks, bounds/styles/visibility, canvas/visualViewport, session, errors and
context loss. Capture report then Copy report after inactive UI occurs; flag persists
through refresh. Diagnostic reads and listeners never consume input. Exact iPad failure
not reproduced; debug mode gathers evidence, does not claim a compositor repair.

DEVICE965: no-UV object refuses Paint; UV object opens from bottom. Inspect top Layers
and settings below, browse radial choices then Pencil paint hides it; background hold
reopens. Long Smudge/lift keeps pixels. Fingers/UndoRedo and Done. Enable UI Debug,
reproduce right-side failure, Capture report → Copy report and send report.


.965 validation: full local Node24 suite2810 PASS/0 FAIL/0 skipped (90.1s);
focused production/UI/hold/debug/Smudge and release checks passed. Revised old tests
only where user-directed UI changed (radial persistence, scalar-layer visibility,
removed Object Paint sector); retained raster cancel/refusal and protected gizmo
bounds/navigation assertions. Old fixed732 shared-dock pin assertion now uses reviewed
cache contract; negative background test mutates BOTH native hold branches; debug
fixture preserves multiple observers and existing runtime-error extraction boundary.
.964 rendering issue remains OPEN; debug report is diagnostic evidence, not a fix.
Runtime publication and hosted CI proof are verified separately after this commit.


## .966 — continuing Smudge input windows; startup toolbar evidence — 25 October 2026

User .965 PASS protects bottom Paint entry, persistent radial, Layers-first LEFT
settings and kept Smudge pixels. User reports Smudge still stops after5–6 passes.
Original8M raster work cap was contact-wide; renew ONLY its work counters per native
Smudge input sample, retaining before snapshot/coverage/pickup/dirty pixels. A bounded
sample may pause dabs, next input resumes. At original12000 path-dab cap, reseed same
original path owner from last screen input while retaining the raster contact. No
extra checkpoints or layer finish until physical lift: Undo remains one stroke.
Cancel/checkpoint refusals retain atomic rollback. Brush/Fill/Eraser/Blur unchanged.

User supplied .965 debug report from refresh failure:1366×886, canvas1366×826CSS /
2732×1652pixels atDPR2, paintfalse/sessionnull/controlsenabled; sampled right CANVAS
contacts reach window bubble. No broad overlay in those canvas samples. This does NOT
prove toolbar hit testing or compositor painting healthy: original grid startsY71
below60px header and omitted .top-actions/right button rects. User confirms refresh
can enter failed state directly. Extend existing debug report with exact right-button
rect/styles/disabled/expanded/centre hit stacks; capture these on persisted-debug
startup/pageshow/lifecycle and toolbar click. No root cause or rendering fix claimed.

DEVICE966: long repeated Smudge passes under one Pencil contact continue; lift keeps
result, ONE Undo/Redo restores whole contact, cancel restores pre-contact. All .965
UI flow remains. Enable UI Debug, refresh directly into right failure, Capture/Copy
new report containing controls and startup evidence; tap affected right button first
if practical. Exact toolbar probe distinguishes offscreen/disabled/occlusion from
DOM-healthy but visually broken UI; native iPad rendering gate remains OPEN.


.966 validation: full local Node24 suite2813 PASS/0 FAIL/0 skipped (95.0s);
focused Smudge/gesture/UI/debug/Lab/release41 PASS. New checks prove renewed work
windows retain pixels and cancellation baseline; long actual surface-picked Smudge
passes original12000 path budget, edits late pixels and commits ONE Undo/Redo entry;
right toolbar centre probes include headerY30 and persist in pageshow evidence.
Prior .965 hosted regression40181206048 has now completed SUCCESS. Exact supplied
refresh report observations are archived in docs/ui-debug-refresh-965-report.md.
Right-side native iPad failure remains OPEN; no rendering fix inferred.


## .967 — canvas/UI composition boundary; .966 invisible clickable controls — 25 October 2026

User reports right controls remain clickable while visually absent; switching away
to ChatGPT and back restores appearance. Exact .966 report10:22:08Z shows right
buttons on-screen/enabled/visible/opacity1, no transforms/filters/clip paths, exact
button/SVG hit stacks; Undo click reaches window bubble. Paintfalse/sessionnull.
Startup toolbar grows from134.56px wide at459ms to317.61px at649ms, with correct
layout but reported invisible pixels. Evidence points to painting/compositing, not
removed UI, offscreen layout, disabled controls or broad input interception. This
is an inference, NOT a locally reproduced WebKit-engine diagnosis.

Targeted repair in original stylesheet: viewportWrap isolated stack atz0, original
canvas bounded by contain:paint with its ownz0; header remainsz10 above viewport.
Header/status/Object Browser get isolated compositing hints via will-change:opacity,
without transforms, opacity changes, clipping UI menus or reparenting any control.
VIEW fixed popup remains viewport-relative; floating tools retain their own owners.
Original viewport-sizing scheduler now coalesces focus and visible-document events
through SAME resize/repaint owner; hidden-document events do not redraw. Teardown
removes both listeners. No synthetic resize, per-frame polling, DOM hiding, reload,
new renderer/history/input owner or modelling/paint changes. Debug snapshot records
contain/isolation/will-change so .967 layer rules can be verified on device.

.965 Paint UI PASS protected; .966 continuing-Smudge acceptance remains separate.
DEVICE967: refresh in landscape repeatedly, verify all right buttons/status and
Object Browser; interact before changing apps, enter/exit UV Editor and Paint,
rotate/orbit. Switch away/back verifies recovery does not lose UI/work. If invisible
controls recur, enable UI Debug before refresh and send Capture/Copy report plus
screenshot if practical. Repair remains an iPad gate until explicit feedback.


.967 validation: full local Node24 suite2815 PASS/0 FAIL/0 skipped (93.9s);
focused release/sizing/UV/Paint/debug checks40 PASS. New coverage checks focus/visible
return coalescing, hidden-document refusal and disposal; canvas containment and
untransformed/unclipped VIEW popup contract retained. A local Chromium layout smoke
was attempted but the installed Playwright package has no browser executable here;
no rendered-browser or native WebKit proof claimed. User's .966 report is archived
in docs/ui-debug-invisible-controls-966.md. Device visual gate remains OPEN.


## .967 protected user PASS — 25 October 2026

- [ ] Extrude12/Bevel3 and original tool actions/disabled states retained.
- [ ] Slide/Bevel/Loop/CutUV/StitchUV/UndoRedo and navigation remain usable.
- [ ] Face/Vertex/Object icons and Array PASS unchanged; watch right UI visibility.

## .975 World-plane Extrude pads

User .974 icons PASS; .975 functional gate separate.

- [ ] Both Edge/Vertex Extrude show original XY/XZ/YZ plane squares, selection highlight and named-plane badge.
- [ ] World XY holdsZ/XZ holdsY/YZ holdsX during drag, Exact and Repeat; arbitrary view orientation supported.
- [ ] CentreFree and XYZ arrows remain unchanged; Done/cancel/UndoRedo/navigation restore normally.
- [ ] Parallel-view refusals do not mutate mesh/history or leave captured input; orbit then retry.


## .976 — reconnect ready Edge Bridge selections — 26 October 2026

Audit main81ba4afd/build975. User supplies screenshot975 and exact Edge Fail(1).obj
(24 vertices/14 quads); retain unchanged fixture tests/fixtures/edge-bridge-976.obj.
The highlighted boundary pair is OBJ vertices3–10 and23–24 (runtime edges12/35).
Both have one face owner. Existing fully installed Open Chain Bridge accepts the pair,
creates quad[3,23,24,10] (OBJ one-based) and passes original topology validation.

session: delegate ready-pair eligibility to existing bridgeEdgeSelectionInfo, retain
single-loop guided entry, sync Apply immediately, show ready status. Original UI,
topology, winding/quality/transaction guards and history own Apply unchanged.
Cancel retains initial pair; invalid/interior/missing/single-open-edge inputs refuse.
No new kernel/gesture, gizmo changes, renderer fixes or icon work.975 pad acceptance

## .977 — radial wiring audit and near-front Exact Extrude — 26 October 2026

User requests audit of all radial tools; orbit sometimes changes Through refusal.

Vertex14/Object13/Paint10), original targets/availability/context adapters/action owners:
 docs/radial-wiring-audit-2026-10-26.md. No missing action owner or wrong-mode target
found in source review; this is not exhaustive native-gesture/mesh certification.
976 Bridge launcher defect repaired/published; all3 changed live files byte-match.
Baseline976 FULL2833PASS/0FAIL/0skip (100.7s), focused225PASS.

Confirmed separate Exact bug: precision-face projected-normal fallback threshold1e-5px

camera band. Existing bevel-inset750 face7, camera centre+normal*5+(0,1e-6,0): Exact
-2.2 incorrectly extrudes+2.2; orbit.01 cuts inward. Align ORIGINAL precision cutoff
to gesture1e-4 ONLY. No main/drag/kernel/geometry/history/inference/physical input change.
Dynamic precision-face child and drawer-ui parent/shell keys977 refreshed; original
internal stamps retained. Reviewed hashes and release recovery/shell markers977.
Three new tests use actual precision projection + native controller/fallback:10 angles,
exact closed output/UndoRedo, old-code mutation sensitivity, five physical drags and
pure-plan invariance. Focused final128PASS/0FAIL/0skip, not full977 rerun.

User's physical Through refusal remains unproven on affected model. Camera changes
projected dragging and reference inference; no blanket refusal fix claimed. Audit
also records two follow-ups: numeric synthetic input still traverses inference, and
precision success/readback lacks downstream commit acknowledgement. Keep these OPEN
for narrow result/constraint work; don't relax topology guards or replace kernel.

New visibility evidence while977 prepared: exact976 report04:53:18Z shows hide canvas
at24626, rightUI visible observation35014, restore37246. User confirms controls STAY
visible after Show3D. Top-level hidden:false is restored state. Layout/styles/hits
healthy throughout; noPaint/session, plain972 active. This implicates a canvas/UI
painting interaction but no engine root cause or permanent fix is proven. Retain
OPEN recurrence and device-proven manual Hide3D→Show3D recovery; no automatic blink,
poll/reload/renderer change. See docs/ui-canvas-probe-976.md for precise evidence.

DEVICE977: confirm977, same negative Exact on near-front then slightly orbited view;
UndoRedo; retry original physical Through with inference off/on, send exact refusal

## .978 — Edge Bridge preview before Apply — 26 October 2026

User clarifies976 commits after Apply but does not PREVIEW, unlike accepted Face
Bridge. This is a missing interaction stage, not failed bridge topology. Prior976
ready-pair launcher repair retained; no broad976/977 PASS inferred. Audit mainf6a3ff30,
same guided Edge session had no preview owner; Face Bridge mutates preview mesh,
while accepted Face/Vertex Bevel already shares a rendering-only blue ghost helper.
Reuse existing createFaceBevelPreview/disposeFaceBevelPreview unchanged for Edge.

SAME selection-hub-bridge-session builds original bridgeSelectedEdges on private
clone and renders changed polygons with original blue translucent fill/wire helper.
Original source/selection/metadata/history/project remain untouched until Apply;
no new modelling/triangulation/history kernel, manager mesh replacement or renderer.
Candidate clone calls preserve active state.mesh despite historical edges observers.
Selection-key cache reuses preview during orbit; selected-boundary change rebuilds it,
incompatible/quality-refused candidates clear it. Guided first loop shows no ghost
until compatible second boundary selected. Apply disabled without actual preview.
Apply runs original bridge-ui commit once; Cancel removes ghost and retains initial
selection. Existing UndoRedo works. Preview renderer/helpers and Face Bridge unchanged.

Session owns source snapshot key, object/mode/lock/scene context. External geometry/
metadata changes, object/mode/tool change, pagehide dispose ghost WITHOUT restoring
stale mesh/selection or closing newer tool UI. Original background-exit route still
calls close; no new raw-pointer owner, per-frame polling or source rollback. Shared
geometry/material disposal occurs once. Overlay is transient outside scene object
manager and uses established Bevel blue style, not saved geometry or a second body.

Focused232PASS/0FAIL/0skip (~0.67s): original Bridge/radial/selection contracts and977
camera regressions; four added real-controller/Three scene tests prove visible ghost
BEFORE Apply with no source/history changes, one-step commit+UndoRedo, selection
update/removal/Cancel, source/object/mode/tool/pagehide cleanup, no-scene refusal and
single geometry/two material disposal. Existing976 harness supplies real scene/shared
preview functions; no old geometry/history assertion removed. No native iPad visual
acceptance inferred. Runtime change ONLY original Edge Bridge session; session/recovery
pins978, unchanged716 renderer import explicitly reviewed in asset contract.

DEVICE978: select same two boundary edges → Edge radial Bridge: BLUE span visible
BEFORE Apply. Orbit to inspect; Apply keeps bridge and removes blue, UndoRedo.
Cancel removes blue, preserves original mesh/selection. Guided two-loop selection
updates preview as second boundary is selected. Face Bridge remains unchanged.
Right-side fault stays OPEN with confirmed manual Hide3D→Show3D recovery; no rendering
repair or other .977 exact/inference/readback follow-up included. Next native preview
feedback, then evidence-led canvas/UI work and remaining audit follow-ups.

## .979 — Exact inference isolation and truthful commit readback; Bridge978 PASS — 26 October 2026

User explicitly PASSes978 Bridge preview before Apply/Cancel; protect its private
clone/blue ghost/source-neutral preview/one-step original commit and lifecycle.
User /nextbuild authorizes the two remaining Exact audit fixes. Audit remote/current
main028718a9, release978. Existing numeric gestures already use reserved pointer9876;
existing direct committed event owns successful geometry values. No new kernel needed.

Original Face referenceUnderPointer now ignores ONLY numeric pointer9876. Physical
Pencil/mouse inference and toggle state stay unchanged. Covers Extrude and Inset;
original model-unit/direction mapping,977 aligned near-front projection, Through
shell-exit snapping and inset safety clamp remain. Exact still enters original
controller and guarded geometry/history owners; no separate modelling algorithm.

Precision tracks one synchronous numeric request and listens to ORIGINAL
boxlab-face-direct-committed. It records success/Repeat/readback only after that
semantic acknowledgement, using ACTUAL committed value rather than requested input.
Existing positive/recess/closed-negative/Inset events retained; old open-sheet
Through success branch now emits same semantic event after original guarded commit.
Example: requested-2.2 stopping at shell exit-2.0 records/displays-2.0. Inset request
above safe range displays original clamped distance, never an unperformed100.

No acknowledgement means false/refused status, no fake value-committed event, prior
successful per-tool Repeat/value retained. Refusal readout survives subsequent status
observer callbacks, even with no prior success; next physical press/Exact attempt/
success clears it. Blank/zero/nonfinite input and absent history refuse before
synthetic geometry dispatch. Original refusal/rollback/selection/history remain.
Physical drag callbacks still record geometry normally. This is transaction reporting,
not relaxation of topology refusal or proof of user's physical Through failure repair.

Final517 focusedPASS/0FAIL/0skip (8.7s): new7 actual precision+direct-controller tests
plus Face/Through/negative/repeat/radial/Bridge/release regression. New fixtures run
original uniform-inset owner rather than centre-lerp fallback. Test exact.37 at3
cameras, Through at4near/oblique views, actual exit depth, UndoRedo/one checkpoint,
refused entire-solid cut with unchanged source/history/last value, actual clamped
Inset, numeric invalid/no-history refusal, real physical vertex inference vs same
numeric contact, persistent failure readout. No native iPad acceptance inferred.
Changed functionality ONLY precision-face and3lines in original multi-face-direct;
drawer-ui changes child pin only. Reviewed parent/child/direct/recovery pins979 and
shell markers/asset hashes. Main/geometry/Through kernels/Bridge978/Multi1.0/frozen/
icons/972plain/973probe remain unchanged. No duplicate history or input owner.

DEVICE979: with inference ON, Face Exact.37 (or convenient value), orbit/Undo/retry;
result should retain entered distance. Valid Through overshoot displays actual exit.
Try a refused cut: explicit refusal, previous successful value retained; Undo must
undo the last successful operation, not an invented failed action. Physical snap
still works. Bridge preview978 remains accepted. Right-side fault still OPEN; manual
Hide3D→Show3D recovery confirmed. Next evidence-led canvas/UI work or actual979
feedback; no new feature/icon expansion before outstanding reliability direction.

## .980 — explicit File Refresh display recovery; .979 user PASS — 26 October 2026

User PASS979 protects Exact inference isolation, actual commit readback, refusal/
last-value/history and existing physical snapping. Bridge978 PASS remains protected.
Audit main2f2ee78a/release979. Next reliability focus is recurring right-side UI.
976 device probe proved Hide3D restored controls and Show3D left them visible; this
narrows canvas/UI painting interaction but does not establish root cause. No further
speculative CSS/layer/renderer change or permanent repair claim in980.

Add File → Refresh display, available WITHOUT enabling debug. It uses SAME existing
createCanvasVisibilityProbe inline visibility save/restore owner. Explicit user click
hides ONLY original canvas for one presented frame (two RAF callbacks), then restores
exact original visibility value/priority/absence.250ms timer fallback and pagehide/
hidden-document/debug-off cancellation ensure restoration if animation frames stall.
No reload, canvas re-creation/resize/DPR/model/history/selection mutation, new renderer,
automatic recurring blink, idle polling, navigation or pointer owner. Debug off stays
off; File closes after successful start, button resets after restore. Confirmation
says Display refreshed, not that the fault is permanently fixed.

Pending refresh rejects repeats and does not take over manually hidden debug probe.
Existing probe busy guard now also checks main/Face/Edge/Vertex/Bevel live drags;
Paint/tool session/gizmo guards retained. Refused entry leaves work untouched and
asks to finish active operation or Show3D. Debug probe/observation buttons disabled
briefly during recovery. Optional debug logs record start/end and invalidate stale
cached reports. Original two-step diagnostic and user-observation flow unchanged.

Final39 focusedPASS/0FAIL/0skip (0.28s): new4 recovery tests + existing debug/display/
canvas973/Bridge978/Exact979/release contracts. Exact inline restoration across6
initial states, hidden frame before restore, stalled-frame fallback, cancel/late-frame
cleanup, busy/manual-probe refusal, scheduler failure restoration, actual File entry
with debugOFF, pagehide/debug-off cleanup, unchanged backing dimensions and model/
history identity tested. Original973 tests retained. Shared test helper only gains
optional File host. No native iPad recovery-speed/visual acceptance inferred.
Runtime change ONLY gesture-debug; direct shell/recovery pins980 and reviewed hashes.
979 modelling/Exact,978 Bridge/shared renderer, main/Multi1.0/icons/frozen unchanged.

DEVICE980: File→Refresh display: canvas returns automatically, model/selection stay;
UndoRedo still acts on actual prior modelling changes. No debug enable required.
When right controls next disappear, use this one action; report if they return and
stay visible. Existing manual Hide3D→Show3D remains available if brief refresh does
not reproduce its recovery. This is convenient evidence-based RECOVERY, not a claim
that intermittent painting fault is fixed. Next follow native feedback and investigate
canvas/UI boundary from evidence; retain all protected979/978 interactions.

## .981 — UV popup top layer and complete surface teardown; .980 recovery PASS only — 26 October 2026

User980 PASS accepts explicit recovery, but rejects needing manual Refresh as a
solution and supplies reproducible UV window report07:51:09Z. Keep right-side visual
failure OPEN; don't misrecord980 as UI repair PASS.979 Exact and978 Bridge protected.
Audit currentmaina00685a8: eventchain is Object UVtools88180→meshHealthClose92850→
finalsessionnull, no UV Editor/paint/displayrefresh needed. Controls/geometry/hits
healthy; hidden sharedhost remains viewport-contained with z134/overflowauto/
containlayoutpaint/isolationisolate. Source end lacked viewport-style/placement
cleanup. Exact evidence summary in docs/ui-uv-trigger-980.md; no proven engine cause.

Repair original tool-session-ui owner, NOT an automatic workaround. UV tools uses
manual native Popover top layer if supported; original host/control nodes remain in
DOM so existing scoped wide CSS/listeners/actions survive. Fixed positioning follows
viewport top+12px; dynamic viewport height bounds, window/visual resize listeners
active only while shown. Original .958 transformfree position retained, but failed
paint-containment layer removed. Transparent noninteractive backdrop, inherited text
colour; no modal/inert/focus-trap or new raw-pointer owner. Other tools unchanged.

On Close/context switch, hide/release native surface before returning original
controls; clear popover/dock/wide flags and ALL inline viewport styles; park empty
hidden host back in drawer. UV Editor handoff explicitly suspends source surface
before first workspace paint while preserving original logicalsession until Back/
Close. Thus no empty top-layer popup above2D editor. Existing workspace952 and all
UV/atlas/history/math owners untouched. Native unsupported/throwing API falls back
safely to original untransformed absolute panel, without containment; same cleanup.
No canvasvisibility/refresh/resize/renderer reset, timer, per-frame polling or mesh
change introduced. Existing manual recovery remains available but is not invoked.

Existing debug snapshot now includes source-parent/popover/topLayer state plus
meshHealthSession and boxlabUVWorkspace, so native rendering mode/clean close can be
verified if recurrence persists. This is evidence, not replacement controls.
364 targetedPASS/0FAIL/0skip (4.5s):5new controller/native-API-double tests cover15

OriginalUV/workspace/session/health/debug/Bridge/Exact/release checks retained.958
test now rejects old containment rather than preserving a mitigation that failed
ondevice. No local native WebKit visual reproduction/guaranteed permanent repair
claimed. Device must confirm this structural source fix prevents the trigger.

Changed runtime only original sharedsession/meshhealth handoff/debug evidence; direct

DEVICE981: without Refresh/app-switch/rotation, repeatedly Object→UV→Close, inspect
right toolbar/status each cycle; then Auto atlas/Open UV Editor/Back and orbit to
right edge. Controls must stay drawn and usable. UI Debug if recurrence: host parent

Do not close visual issue from automated PASS. Next actual981device result before

## .982 Paint icons and protected .981 UV lifecycle

- [x] User PASS981: repeated UV open/Close and Editor return keep right controls visible without Refresh display; retain native top-layer release/host teardown.
- [x] User PASS982: all10 Paint icons match selected Proof03 with readable captions; original centre/control placements and selected/disabled feedback stay usable.
- [x] User PASS982: Brush/Blur/Smudge and Layers/Mask/Image/AO/Map size open original left controls; cycling keeps radial until Pencil surface use; background hold reopens.
- [ ] DEVICE982: Paint UndoRedo/Done, modelling icons and UV Close/right toolbar stay accepted.
- [x] Artwork audit:10 valid SVGs exact to Proof03, zero target-box overlaps, bounds fit existing350px radial.


## .983 startup toolbar / refresh recurrence

- [ ] OPEN: user982 reports invisible right controls immediately after refresh; several refreshes recovered.981 UV acceptance does not close startup visibility.
- [ ] DEVICE983: repeated reloads retain drawn right toolbar/status before navigation, UV entry, app-switch or rotation.
- [ ] DEVICE983: Frame All/UndoRedo/Focus/Objects/VIEW work once on original owners; right browser/menu bounds unchanged.
- [ ] DEVICE983: UV open/Close/Editor Back and accepted Paint icons/workflow remain usable.
- [x] Automated: single final ordered toolbar in shell; original VIEW/SVG nodes retained on hydration; Objects/Frame bind once; real camera fit; fallback creation retained.

## .983 native feedback — first-refresh failure

- [x] User functional PASS983 recorded; accepted Paint982 and original toolbar actions retained.
- [ ] FAILED/OPEN: first refresh still loses right controls on983; startup shell stabilization did not pass native visibility.
- [ ] Capture fresh983 UI Debug on FIRST failed load before any recovery or app-switch; static-toolbar hypothesis is not a confirmed root cause.

## .983 ground-region evidence — 27 October 2026

- [ ] OPEN: new capture has visible UI but missing right ground shading. Keep separate from earlier invisible-controls failure.
- [x] Supplied startup/pageshow toolbar width stable317.609375; canvas2732x1652; no active UV top layer. DOM evidence does not establish floor/shadow rendering.
- [x] Initial screenshot inspected: .983 top-right controls visible; straight vertical shading seam near right quarter; floor continues on both sides, separate sloping distant edge.
- [ ] Small orbit WITHOUT refresh/app-switch: report whether seam stays fixed on screen, moves with ground, or disappears before choosing source change. No repeat initial screenshot/debug dump needed.

## .984 selected-face group authoring

- [ ] Face mode: select faces, VIEW > Facegroups > name > Assign selected; only chosen faces change group.
- [ ] Same name joins group; different name separates; Clear selected leaves other groups intact.
- [ ] Undo/Redo, Save/Open retain groups and geometry/UVs; no UV requirement.
- [ ] No selection/wrong mode/active tool/locked/linked/recipe objects refuse without history.
- [x] Automated metadata, unchanged geometry/source, no-op, validation/refusal and checkpoint tests pass.
- [ ] Intermittent right-region rendering/gizmo loss remains OPEN; cannot currently reproduce, not repaired.

## .985 group-name reuse / .984 accepted

- [x] User PASS984 protects selected-face group assignment/clear, UndoRedo and Save/Open.
- [ ] Select faces in one group; Use selected group name copies its name, changes no faces or history.
- [ ] Mixed/ungrouped/no selection refuses pickup and retains current name.
- [ ] Focus name input: existing names offered once each; rename choice followed by Assign selected joins group.
- [ ] UndoRedo affects actual assignment only; Save/Open retains accepted984 behavior.
- [x] Automated read-only reuse, invalid/mixed refusal and safe option.value insertion checks pass.

## .986 Pencil facegroup strokes

- [x] User PASS985 protects existing-name reuse and984 authoring/history/save baseline.
- [ ] Face mode > VIEW Facegroups > name > Pencil facegroup strokes; stroke visible faces, lift assigns group. No UV required.
- [ ] Colours update ON LIFT; each changed stroke is one Undo/Redo entry, no-op strokes add none.
- [ ] Fingers navigate; second canvas contact cancels current stroke; Stop restores ordinary selection.
- [ ] Change/pick name and rearm; switch look stops brush; Save/Open retains groups.
- [x] Automated pure/real owner routing covers source-neutral staging, cancellation, lost capture/pagehide, controls restoration, stale context, one checkpoint and background Pencil navigation.
- [ ] Native Pencil/gesture acceptance pending; rendering fault remains OPEN independently.

## .987 Pencil facegroup eraser

- [x] User PASS986 protects named Pencil strokes and accepted history/navigation.
- [ ] VIEW Facegroups > Erase group strokes; sampled faces become ungrouped ON LIFT.
- [ ] Other groups/geometry/UVs unchanged; one Undo/Redo per changed erase stroke.
- [ ] Already ungrouped stroke adds no history; switch back to named strokes and Stop.
- [ ] Save/Open and finger navigation remain accepted; native eraser review pending.
- [x] Automated eraser staging/no-op/untouched data/checkpoint/cancel/switch tests pass.

## .988 existing-group dropdown repair / rendering recurrence

- [ ] Native Existing group dropdown opens on iPad; select existing name, assign new faces.
- [ ] Original Group text input creates new names; reopening VIEW lists current mesh groups.
- [ ] Selector choice changes no geometry/history and stops prior brush; UndoRedo affects actual assignment.
- [ ] Eraser987 and Save/Open remain device review; no987 PASS inferred.
- [x] Automated actual option population/change callbacks, refresh/empty/text safety and retained authoring/stroke regressions pass.
- [ ] OPEN: lower-right/VIEW menu blank or gone in987. DOM/hit health does not prove pixel rendering. See docs/ui-right-region-987.md.

## .989 VIEW panel diagnostics / .988 acceptance

- [x] User PASS988 protects native Existing group dropdown and related authoring flow.
- [ ] Normal VIEW/scroll/group picker remain usable with debug off.
- [ ] If fault recurs, debug on > VIEW attempt > Capture/Copy before recovery; report includes viewMenu.open, panel nodes/scroll and render/stroke state.
- [ ] No forced reproduction needed if fault absent; rendering issue stays OPEN.
- [x] Actual report/observer tests distinguish open/closed/missing, capture scroll/modes, keep DOM unchanged and avoid measurements when debug off.

## .990 closed VIEW surface lifecycle

- [ ] Fresh launch/reload: right UI drawn; VIEW closed initially, no ghost panel surface.
- [ ] Repeated VIEW open/close, scroll, group picker and tool buttons retain behavior.
- [ ] Debug closed VIEW: panel displaynone/zero rect; open VIEW: ordinary panel bounds/scroll.
- [x] Original toolbar/action/node identity, release and debug/authoring checks pass.
- [ ] OPEN: native right-region rendering;990 closed-surface hardening is not permanent repair proof.

## .991 compact facegroup paint dock

- [x] User PASS990 protects closed VIEW surface lifecycle and accepted menu/picker behavior.
- [ ] Open facegroup paint controls shows compact LEFT dock; VIEW closes, Face mode selected through original button.
- [ ] Existing group / completed name edit arms Paint; persistent Paint/Erase switch without reopening VIEW.
- [ ] Selected faces advanced Assign/Clear/Use name remain; strokes/UndoRedo/SaveOpen keep original behavior.
- [ ] Done stops brush/hides dock; mode/look/another tool closes it, navigation unaffected. Reopen retains original values.
- [x] Automated original-node/value/listener lifecycle, Done, command routing and active-tool refusal checks pass.
- [ ] Native iPad dock readability/tap/typing/picker gate pending; keep watch for rendering recurrence.

## .991 rendering recurrence evidence

- [x] Native991 VIEW open/close transitions and990 closed displaynone/zero bounds confirmed by report.
- [ ] FAILED/OPEN: user right-region visual loss recurs despite correct menu state; no permanent990 repair claim.
- [ ]991 left dock native UX still pending; parked authoring nodes legitimately have zero bounds until opened.
- [ ] If persistent: compare left dock visibility to affected right region; no repeat canvas/toggle dump requested.

## .992 — facegroup colour/name list; .991 user PASS — 27 October 2026

User confirms991 paint controls work great after refresh and explicitly PASS991.
Protect compact left dock, original controls, persistent Paint/Erase, Done and stroke
history/navigation. Screenshot D8EC492A shows right VIEW border/background with
blank interior before refresh; keep intermittent rendering gate OPEN independently.

992 replaces Existing group native dropdown with a bounded200px layer-style list:
one tap target per named group, colour swatch + safe text name, selected-row highlight.
Name field still creates new groups; choosing a row reuses original input and arms
original Paint mode. Rows are presentation only, no mesh/history/material mutation.
Shared faceGroupPalette exposes EXACT existing viewport mesh-order/golden-ratio
colour map; both renderer and list use it. Palette/reseed/lightness/saturation update
swatches, original rendering algorithm unchanged. Rows keep node/focus identity on
selection/colour refresh; group membership rebuilds layout only when changed.
Refresh current mesh on open, name/edit/selection, palette changes and queued original
body rebuilds (stroke commit, active object switch, UndoRedo); no polling/new pointer
owner. Names are textContent, never HTML. Empty list explains name + paint workflow.
Legacy988 picker tests migrate to new list adapter preserving current-mesh/name/no
mutation coverage; new renderer tests cover selection/identity/empty/text safety,
original brush callback and swatch-to-render-attribute parity across all4 palettes.
Stroke987/authoring985/dock991/UV/Paint/main/Multi1.0 and990 VIEW rule unchanged.
Validation:93 targeted PASS/0FAIL/0skip; syntax and diff checks pass. Reviewed
changed render/core/new-list and shell/recovery cache keys; no full-suite/native
rendering proof claimed. The prior985 safe-text assertion now targets list labels
instead of native option implementation.992 awaits iPad list acceptance.

Future user goal: Facegroup boundaries define UV island seams, then group-targeted
image/PBR assignment. Audit original UV atlas/seam/stitch and paint mask/material
owners first. First likely route shared atlas with per-group masks/baking; separate
material slots require renderer/save/OBJ/GLB/NOM audit. This build DOES NOT implement
unwrap-by-groups or per-group materials, and must not imply they exist. Same-name
disconnected face patches may yield multiple islands; geometry stays welded.

DEVICE992: open Facegroups paint dock; paint2+ group names, inspect swatch/name rows.
Tap rows and paint/erase; selected name/highlight and UndoRedo refresh list. Adjust
VIEW palette/reseed and reopen dock: swatches follow viewport base colours (lighting
can shade model). Long names/many groups stay compact; Done/finger navigation.

## .993 — Face Apply Exact native-pointer capture repair — 27 October 2026

User reports Apply Extrude Exact does not work and traps the user in Extrude.
Audited current main5967db29/build992, original Face popup/precision/direct controller,
Pencil gate and Through fallback. No new geometry, history or gesture owner needed.
Confirmed regression: numeric Exact dispatches reserved synthetic pointer9876, but
original pointerdown AND beginDirectDrag call native setPointerCapture for it. Browsers
reject this nonexistent native pointer with NotFoundError. EventTarget reports handler
exceptions and continues dispatch; begin had already set drag, leaving pending press
alive too. Pointerup clears pending press first, leaving drag set; popup then disables
Exact/input/Done indefinitely. Earlier tests used a no-op capture stub and missed it.

Only runtime change: original multi-face-direct capture helper skips reserved numeric
pointer9876 at all three existing capture sites. Physical contacts retain native capture,
original window-capture completion, deliberate-drag threshold, selection, inference,
geometry/topology/refusal/Through safety and history. Exact still runs original
controller and semantic commit acknowledgement; no new numeric modelling kernel.
Popup and precision code unchanged. Shell/direct/recovery keys993 reviewed; no dynamic
child changes. Protected Multi1.0, main, accepted icons/Facegroup/Paint/UV/frozen unchanged.

Test helper now optionally models browser capture rejection and EventTarget exception
continuation; default fixtures still throw unexpected listener failures. Before runtime
repair, new tests reproduced false Exact success result and stranded dragging state.
After repair: repeated Extrude/Inset Exact, safe refusal then valid retry, no synthetic
capture/no listener errors/no pending drag, actual popup Apply/Done lifecycle, one history
step per success and UndoRedo pass. Physical capture/commit/cancel retained. Final191
focused PASS/0FAIL/0skip (~5.2s), including original Face/repeat/popup/camera/Through/
negative-extrude/release tests; syntax/diff checks pass. No full-suite or native proof claimed.

Separate992 rendering recurrence at05:39:15Z: user observed rightUI missing with canvas
hidden at47438, then restored canvas50523. Native VIEW open34532 had bounds998/66/360/
811.984 and980px scroll content; closed panel is displaynone/zero bounds. Toolbar layout/
hits healthy; gizmo present196x196 at752.75/443.234. Studio overlay opacity0. Group-list
optionCount/selectedIndex null is expected for992 DIV list, not a native-select failure.
No actual screenshot/affected region identified in this report; do not infer a new
rendering cause or guaranteed Hide3D recovery. Intermittent right-region visibility
remains OPEN; no rendering changes in993.992 list device acceptance still pending;
991 PASS retained. Facegroup-seam UV/material work remains future, not shipped.

DEVICE993: confirm993; select cube face, Extrude, enter0.2 (or convenient model units),
Apply Exact twice; both operations commit and Done exits. UndoRedo each step. Reopen
and try a valid negative recess; a refused value must still allow Done and later retry.
Ordinary Pencil drag then Done; Inset Exact sanity check. Watch existing right-region
fault separately. Next obtain device Exact/exit feedback before feature expansion.

### .993 publication status

Runtime/tested local commit b9fed522f95ae61fe82d58f912706acca194f8db, tree
bd178a99b8bac3b0a4947e070cde16edcf84aed8. All191 focused tests pass. Push was
blocked twice by automatic approval review. Live992/main5967db29 remains the last
verified publication; do not describe993 as shipped or ask for device993 tests yet.
Review rejected standing authorization in retrieved AI_WORKFLOW.md as insufficient
end-user authorization in this transcript. Await explicit user confirmation to push
and publish993 to main; do not bypass rejection with connector or alternate transport.
After approval push pending local commits, fetch main, verify release/pins and live
bytes, then give DEVICE993 checks. No runtime edits after validation.

## .994 — distinct native NOM facegroup colours — 27 October 2026

User reports six exported groups arrive in Nomad as near-identical colour pairs.
Audit found native NOM meshPart cycles the donor template's THREE group colours;
six generated groups therefore contain only three unique RGB triples. New test
reproduces3-versus6 before repair. GLB already generates golden-ratio-spaced colours
for new groups and deliberately preserves imported Nomad group colours; unchanged.

Native NOM now reuses existing faceGroupPalette992 for all exported named groups,
using original exported face order/names, default spaced palette and linear RGB.
No new palette algorithm. This is facegroup display metadata, not paint, vertex
colour, material or texture assignment. Group IDs/names/boundaries, welded geometry,
UVs, PBR maps, donor template bytes, source mesh and history remain unchanged. Native
unnamed faces still map to original Main group. Does not promise VIEW custom palette/
reseed fidelity or change preserved GLB colours. Runtime change ONLY native exporter;
packed-map/panel/Lab files change loader pins only to refresh the original graph.
Reviewed994 shell/recovery/panel/packed/core/Lab keys and shared palette992 reference.
Multi1.0/main/accepted992 list/993 Exact/frozen bytes unchanged.

Validation139 focused PASS/0FAIL/0skip (~9.6s): native NOM/UV/colour/normal/emissive/
scalar/packed/displacement/export tests,992 swatch list,993 Exact and release contracts.
Six named cube groups now have six deterministic RGB triples with all pairwise RGB
distances>.2; all six face-to-group IDs and source mesh retained. Existing binary/
texture/group round-trip tests pass. Syntax/diff clean. No native Nomad or full-suite
proof claimed. Intermittent right-region rendering remains OPEN, unrelated to this fix.

LOCAL ONLY: includes pending993 Exact repair. Publication remains blocked by the
prior automatic approval review; no attempt to bypass or repush. Await explicit user
confirmation to push/publish994 to shared main/live app. Live992 is last verified.
After approval, publish pending local commits and verify remote shell/pins/live bytes.
DEVICE994 AFTER PUBLICATION: native NOM export of six differently named facegroups;
open Nomad and enable Facegroup display, verify six distinct colours and six correct
regions/names; geometry/texture appearance intact. Retest993 Exact twice/Done/UndoRedo.
If user's actual export was GLB or OBJ, ask for format/file; native donor-cycle defect
is confirmed, but do not claim it diagnoses every format's similar-colour behavior.

## Standing publication approval — reaffirmed 27 October 2026

User explicitly states in this development chat: “Approval is ALWAYS given - write
that into the Handover notes.” This reaffirms standing authorization for BoxLab
commits, pushes directly to main, and GitHub Pages publication, including pending
build994 and its993 Exact repair. Complete validation, commit/push and verify release
markers/live assets without asking for publishing approval again. Authorization is
for BoxLab development; unrelated external actions are outside this scope.
The earlier993/994 approval-block notes below are historical and superseded by this
explicit user confirmation. They are not a continuing requirement to ask again.
If a future automatic review still blocks publication, report its actual reason;
do not misstate the user's standing authorization or bypass a rejection.

Current delivery:994 runtime8096a013 includes native NOM distinct group colours and
993 Face Exact capture repair.191 focused993 checks and139 focused994 checks passed;
these overlapping sets are not a combined distinct test count. Device acceptance is
pending. Intermittent right-region rendering remains OPEN. Publish pending commits,
verify current main and live version/index/direct/export/packed/core/palette assets,

## .995 — FACEGROUP Face radial and ADD+; .994 user PASS — 27 October 2026

User explicitly PASSes994; protect native NOM distinct group colours and993 Exact
Extrude/Inset capture/Done/UndoRedo repair. User asks Face radial FACEGROUP with
linework cube/red-green-yellow faces, automatic Facegroups look, original left list,
and ADD+ numbered new groups. Existing dock/stroke/authoring/palette remain owners.

Face radial now has24 tools. FACEGROUP reuses original #facegroupOpenPaint target
for inventory but launches original dock SEMANTICALLY (no hidden VIEW button click).
It selects original Facegroups look, closes VIEW and opens same left dock/name/list/
Paint/Erase/selected-face nodes. Original authoring editable-target gate is shared
with Assign, not copied; locked/reference/linked/live-modifier/tool-session/active-
drag targets refuse. Done stops brush, parks controls and emits original Face hub
completion once; another radial tool or mode/session change closes the dock.

All23 pre-existing Face targets, labels, icons, angles/radii and cross-mode shared
placements remain EXACTLY unchanged. FACEGROUP fits between original rings at330°/
r168 with74x60 target and original32px icon/small title format. Three SVG cube faces
red/green/yellow with light linework. New button has no bounds overlap with any old
button. A16-sector outer reflow was considered but rejected because it displaced
shared cross-mode slots; not shipped. No unrelated icon reskin or pointer owner.

ADD+ picks unique Group N, incrementing past current/existing/draft numbers; adds
safe colour/name row and arms original Paint. Does NOT immediately reassign current
selection or create history. Empty groups are UI drafts scoped by actual object
identity in WeakMap, surviving dock close/reopen/object switches in this session.
They are saved/exported ONLY after painting or Assign selected through existing
faceGroups metadata. UI explicitly says paint/assign to save; no new project schema.
Reload/project replacement drops unused drafts. Assigned groups retain original
palette; drafts preview subsequent spaced colours via SAME palette helper. Painting
out of draft order refreshes swatches to actual mesh-order colours (not fixed
user-chosen group colours). Palette/reseed controls remain in VIEW. Safe names and
integer-limit numbering tested; no HTML insertion/model/UV/material/paint changes.

Validation165 targeted PASS/0FAIL/0skip (~1.7s), including8 new draft/real-control/
semantic radial/real dock Done tests, all existing Facegroup data/palette/brush/
eraser/authoring/selector/dock, radial modes/shared positions, accepted994 Exact/
NOM, and reviewed release contracts. All24 embedded Face SVGs parse; syntax and
diff clean. Existing709 Face count23→24 is sole radial contract expansion; original
outer15×24° and shared Edge/Vertex slots stay protected. Picker/dock fixtures adapted
to the original shared open owner and draft adapter without dropping source/selection/
refusal checks. No full-suite/rendered-browser/native iPad proof claimed.

Changed runtime: original render-modes, small drafts helper, original list and shared
editable-authoring gate; stroke changes import pin ONLY. Total Gizmo changes one
button/availability/semantic launch/completion. Reviewed shell/render/stroke/author/
list/drafts/gizmo/icon/recovery995 cache closure. Facegroup palette992 and native NOM994,
993 Exact, main/Multi1.0/UV/Paint/geometry/frozen bytes unchanged.

Right-hand rendering issue stays OPEN. Reviewed latest992 capture: VIEW native open/
close and explicit zero-sized closed panel work; canvas hide did not restore rightUI;
styles/hit stacks cannot establish visible pixels. This build adds direct LEFT dock
access but DOES NOT claim a compositor/right-menu repair. Retain existing diagnostics
and user File Refresh display; do not repeat proven-insufficient blur/closed-details/
canvas-only explanations or force another identical dump. Further rendering work
requires visible affected region/structural reproduction, not speculative CSS churn.

Current runtime/publication evidence lives in docs/publication-995.md (commit/tree,
Pages/live checks and hosted status); consult it before describing publication.
Standing user push/publish approval remains active; do not ask again.
DEVICE995: Face select→radial FACEGROUP cube; auto Facegroups look + original LEFT
list. ADD+ two new numbered rows/different swatches, paint each/erase; UndoRedo one
step per stroke. Done→radial again; ordinary Face Exact and finger navigation.
SaveOpen painted groups; unused drafts are intentionally not saved. Watch right VIEW
menu separately; if recurrence, screenshot/identify visible area, no forced recreation.
Next follow native995 feedback; facegroup-seam UV/material work remains deferred.

## .996 — File menu arrangement from user image — 27 October 2026

User requests File menu order/format from attached IMG_8339.png. Audited current
main44db0b9f/runtime995, existing shell/File/export/project/debug installers and
viewport-contained menu styles. No995 PASS inferred;994 PASS remains protected.

File menu now has four semantic sections in requested order: original Open .boxlab
from Files and Save .boxlab; Import (Editable/Reference, split groups, import);
Export (filename, Format OBJ/GLB, Geometry Base/SubD, Export/Save, NOMAD); utilities
(Home Screen, Reset, UI Debug, Refresh display, Check project snapshot). Shell
supplies named slots; original project/debug installers append SAME original buttons,
inputs/status nodes/listeners there with existing-host fallbacks. No cloning, second
menu/handler, observers, keyboard/tab-order CSS tricks or new save/export owners.
Original Quick OBJ and Lab link nodes remain hidden for legacy owners; duplicate
Quick OBJ/Lab entry is omitted from visible requested menu.

Scoped file-menu.css gives consistent section rules/gaps/uppercase headings,320px
viewport-bounded width,36px action targets,32px segmented controls, aligned filename
field and readable12px text. Max-height tracks original topbar/safe area; vertical
scroll/touch-pan/overscroll containment remain. Hidden attributes honored; empty
slots/status do not leave gaps. No new blur/filter/transform/contain/compositor hint.
Other UI styles unchanged. This does not repair recurring right-region rendering.

Runtime changes only shell/layout stylesheet and original object-management/debug
installer destinations. Project codec/history/save/open/geometry/selection, export/
NOM/paint/UV/995 Facegroup/993 Exact/Multi1.0/frozen unchanged. Reviewed996 shell/new
CSS/project-installer/debug/recovery pins and asset hashes; internal stamps retained.
All original File action/input IDs retained once. HTML sections/order/unique IDs
checked. Existing50 menu input/config/name/layout/toolbar/project Open/GLB/paint/
display-refresh/release checks PASS/0FAIL/0skip (~1.12s); JS syntax/diff clean. No
new cosmetic tests or full-suite/native rendered proof claimed. Publication commit/
tree/live evidence is recorded in docs/publication-996.md before completion.

DEVICE996: File shows Open/Save first, then Import/Export/utilities as image; spacing,
filename/segmented controls readable. Scroll to bottom in landscape and portrait.
Save/Open a test .boxlab; import/export and NOMAD original actions; Refresh display
still available. Do not reset a working model to test styling. Right-menu rendering
remains OPEN;995 Facegroup device acceptance still pending. Standing publication
approval retained. Next follow996 menu/iPad spacing and995 tool feedback.

## .997 — external original VIEW surface; .996 user PASS — 27 October 2026

User996 PASS protects arranged File menu, original actions and spacing. User now
identifies affected surface precisely: VIEW outer frame toggles but its contents
never draw. Report996 at07:41:06Z shows open43289/47255, closed45303/54977. Open
panel998/66/360/811.984,scrollHeight980/clientHeight810; actual saturation/lightness/
reset controls have normal layout bounds. Closed displaynone/zero bounds works.
This is drawn-content failure, not proof of missing nodes or a failed native toggle.
Group-list null optionCount/index is expected DIV list; hidden gizmo in this capture
is not evidence of gizmo painting failure. Do not request another identical report.

User adds a useful chronology clue: current right VIEW trouble seemed to start when
Facegroup items were added. Facegroup controls grow VIEW from earlier Studio754px
content to980px and activate overflow at810px. That points to the fixed scrolling
surface inside native details as a plausible trigger; it is NOT engine/root-cause
proof and does not rewrite older966+ right-region reports as all starting at984.

Existing VIEW panel is a fixed overflowing direct child of native <details>, whose
browser-disclosed contents have a separate visibility/painting lifecycle. New small
view-menu-surface moves that SAME panel ONCE under #app, outside native disclosure
and header clipping/stacking ancestry. Original native #viewModes details.open is
STILL sole open state. One attribute-filtered MutationObserver mirrors current open
into explicit panel.hidden and summary aria-expanded/controls. No duplicate toggle,
open boolean, new raw-pointer owner, second popup/content copy or automatic repaint.
Closed external panel is displaynone/zero-layout from early shell stylesheet onward.
Existing fixed position/width/max-height/scroll/touch styles remain; scroll offset
restores on reopening. Same DOM IDs/values/listeners remain. Rehydration detects
external panel rather than recreating contents. Keyboard Tab/ArrowDown from open
summary enters panel; ShiftTab returns, Escape closes native owner/returns focus.

Original view-modes click/pointerup delegation now binds original external panel;
existing synthesized-click suppression retained. Outside-close accepts BOTH trigger
and panel; active-view highlighting searches stable panel ID. Clean View uses new
ID with legacy fallback, preserving original overlay owner. UI Debug samples new
#viewModesPanel and parentId, retaining existing controls/mode/scroll/toggle evidence.
No canvas/renderer/atmosphere/Paint/UV/facegroup/geometry/history/Multi1.0 changes.
File996 stylesheet and functional owners unchanged. This is a targeted structural
repair requiring native feedback, NOT a proven permanent WebKit/root-cause repair.

Reviewed cache closure: view-modes→new surface997; Clean View→Face workflow→drawer
997; debug/early toolbar/shell/recovery997. Drawer also aligns its stale project-
installer child key938 to accepted shell996, avoiding competing cached installer
versions; no new project installer code. Existing old internal stamps retained.

Final93 focused PASS/0FAIL/0skip (~0.75s):7 new surface identity/observer/idempotence/
coalesced state/scroll/inside-outside activation/Pencil suppression/keyboard tests,
original startup toolbar/FrameAll/menu/Clean View/Facegroup/brush/dock/File/debug/
display/release contracts. JS syntax and diff clean. View scroll test parser now
selects its two max-height-bearing base/media rules instead of also counting990's
closed descendant-display selector; all height/overflow assertions retained, and
997 has explicit closed-surface coverage. No CSS/rendered/native/full-suite proof
claimed from controlled DOM tests. Later hosted status and exact publication/live
proof recorded in docs/publication-997.md; consult before describing delivery.

DEVICE997: fresh997 open VIEW: directions/looks/controls must visibly draw, not only
frame. Compare Studio and Facegroups (overflow case); scroll to bottom, toggle looks
and reopen with finger/Pencil. Close VIEW via trigger/outside tap; open File and
return. Face radial FACEGROUP still opens original left dock. Confirm without app-
switch/Refresh display workaround. .996 PASS is protected;995 acceptance not inferred.
Current VIEW pixel acceptance remains pending; broader historical right-region issue
stays OPEN until native feedback. Next assess997 iPad result before more rendering
changes or facegroup-seam UV/material work. Standing push/publish approval applies.

## .997 initial Studio success; Facegroups transition remains OPEN — 27 October 2026

User: “View works great - there is still a patch on the right that's hiding the
gizmo contents.” Accept/protect997 VIEW rendering repair specifically; do not infer
broad right-region/gizmo acceptance. Keep996 File menu PASS and994 acceptance.

New997 report08:04:53.110Z: Studio/Face, viewport1366x886,DPR2,canvas2732x1652,
controls enabled, no tool session/texture Paint, canvasProbehiddenfalse. Final VIEW
closed, external #viewModesPanel parentapp/hidden/displaynone/zero bounds, so no
retained closed VIEW rectangle is established at capture. totalGizmo explicitly
hidden/displaynone/zero bounds too: this report does NOT capture a visible partly
clipped gizmo. Do not treat that intentional hidden state as spatial clipping proof.
Studio atmosphere is active, opacity1/multiply, but this alone does not prove it
causes the patch (older reports included non-Studio/opacity0 failures). Healthy
right-toolbar layout/hits remain non-pixel evidence.

Toggle-time records at29629/43262/44313 show openTRUE with panelhiddenTRUE; closes
42140/43804/44827 show previous visible panel bounds. Debug observes toggle at window
capture, while surface visibility is mirrored by MutationObserver. These transition
samples can precede the visibility update; they are not by themselves persistent
VIEW failure evidence. User explicitly confirms VIEW now works. Preserve accepted
surface structure; if future reporting work is needed, sample settled state rather
than claiming these transition records show a remaining visible closed panel.

Source audit: Total Gizmo root remains original196px viewport child, translated to
selection; its primary SVG intentionally clips to its own bounds while shortcut SVGs
remain overflowvisible. No specific wrong screen-fixed clip rect or covering DOM node
was established. Do not remove protected SVG clipping or move gizmo parent/coordinates
speculatively. No code/build change from this update. Runtime remains997.

Next useful native evidence: screenshot while gizmo is VISIBLE and crossing patch,
so arrows/rings versus radial labels/buttons and fixed patch boundary can be compared.
Quick Studio→Solid→Studio comparison may separate Studio presentation dependence;
it is a diagnostic comparison, not a guaranteed recovery or engine diagnosis.
No need for another identical dump with gizmo hidden. Preserve original navigation,
selection/history and accepted VIEW owner until evidence supports a narrow repair.
