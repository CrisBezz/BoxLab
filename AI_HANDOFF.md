# BoxLab — AI Development Handoff

## Read this first

This is the living current-state handoff for BoxLab.

Before changing code:
1. read `AI_WORKFLOW.md`
2. read this file completely
3. read `TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
4. read the newest relevant entries in `DEV_HISTORY.md`
5. inspect current `main`

The repository is authoritative. If anything here conflicts with current `main`, reconcile this file before coding.

## Latest completed development — v0.36.18.337

Theme: **existing Rotate Edge consolidated as Flip Edge after mandatory feature audit**.

Existing-feature audit result:
- no current Circle / Regularize tool existed
- existing loop selection, loop slide, Offset Loop and bevel regularity helpers remain separate and unchanged

New Circle behavior:
1. works in Vertex, Edge, or exactly one Face selection
2. Vertex/Edge require one simple closed selected loop; Face uses that face boundary
3. rejects open chains, branches, multiple loops, ambiguous loops and degenerate loops
4. preserves the loop centre
5. preserves the loop working plane
6. uses the average selected loop radius
7. evenly spaces the existing vertices around that circle
8. creates/deletes no topology
9. preserves the current selection
10. commits as one Undo history step

Implementation:
- `src/component-circle-core.js`
- `src/component-circle.js`
- loaded once through `drawer-ui.js`
- Circle control is owned by contextual Vertex / Edge / Face **Active Tools**, not Selection
- Vertex placement: third slot beside Slide / Create Face
- Edge placement: immediately after Delete in the bottom Topology row
- Face placement: beside Poke Faces
- no standalone bottom Circle row remains

Edge Split regression fix:
- canonical additive Multi remains enabled
- `edge-paint-select.js` yields only while Face Split is armed
- `face-split.js` exposes `isArmed()` and participates in `boxlab-direct-tool-exclusive`
- ordinary additive Edge selection resumes immediately after Split is off
- preserve this ordering for future direct Edge tools

Protected transform and Through systems remain untouched.

## Current Clean for SubD pipeline

1. **Four-triangle center-fan repair**
   - conservative local repair
   - guarded manifold/crease/normal/fold/aspect checks

2. **Sliver cleanup**
   - conservative short smooth interior triangle-edge collapse
   - only commits demonstrably safe improvements

3. **Bounded even triangle-island complete matching**
   - connected triangle-only components
   - bounded up to **40 triangles**
   - complete matching required
   - no stranded triangles
   - surrounding quad-flow scoring
   - aggregate patch-quality guard
   - worst-boundary mismatch guard
   - **.319 internal proposed-quad flow-coherence scoring**
   - **.320 smooth-interior valence-aware completed-patch ranking**
   - **.321 worst-local valence-aware completed-patch ranking**
   - **.322 worst-local internal-flow-aware completed-patch ranking**
   - **.323 per-stage topology audit + transactional core rollback**
   - no vertex movement
   - no surrounding-quad rewrite
   - rejected patches remain untouched

4. **Residual safe triangle-pair merge**
   - same surrounding-flow and quality context
   - conservative non-overlapping merge

5. **Guarded all-quad tangent relaxation**
   - safe interior vertices only
   - boundary/crease/non-quad protections
   - commits only when flow improves

The user-facing wrapper validates topology and rolls back invalid results transactionally.

## Important recent selection fix — v0.36.18.314

A regression caused Face multi-select not to work immediately after startup; switching away from Face mode and back made it work.

The fix is `src/component-multi-init.js?v=0.36.18.314`.

It initializes intended additive component multi-selection for Face/Edge/Vertex and restores that state after relevant mode/tool handoffs.

**Protect this behavior.** Fresh-load Face multi-select must work without requiring a mode cycle first.

## Protected interaction baseline

Preserve unless the user explicitly requests otherwise:

- one-finger orbit
- two-finger pan
- pinch zoom
- two-finger tap Undo
- three-finger tap Redo
- no-jump orbit pivot
- persistent selections during navigation
- Studio realtime default/behaviour
- object-management / Multi workflow
- existing snapping
- Knife
- Loop Cut
- Edge Bevel
- Vertex Bevel
- ordinary Extrude
- connected multi-face Extrude
- Inset
- Through, including cavity-aware Through
- Extract
- Bridge
- Join
- Boolean workflows
- Base/SubD export workflows

## Protected files / pins

- **Never casually edit:** `src/multi-object-transform.js?v=0.36.1.0`
- Expected protected blob SHA: `0b6f676900bf9a3787cf420e276bbb0f57ac46ff`
- **Do not casually update:** `styles.css?v=0.36.18.270`
- Preserve `component-multi-init.js?v=0.36.18.314` unless intentionally changing component-selection startup.
- Mature Through behavior is topology-sensitive and regression-prone.
- Clean for SubD must remain transactional.
- No service worker.
- Avoid broad MutationObservers when a narrow module/event hook is possible.
- Old-looking cache pins may be intentional.

## Known watchouts

- The README is older than the live application; do not use it as the authoritative feature/version source.
- Many module cache pins are deliberately old/frozen.
- Clean for SubD is intentionally conservative; “no safe repairs found” can be correct.
- Preserve history/object-manager/selection synchronization around topology commits.
- Failed topology operations must restore the pre-operation mesh.
- Distinguish release commits from later cache-hop, Pages-marker, or handoff-documentation commits.
- Do not infer a new release number just because current `main` has commits after the canonical release commit.

## Next development step

**Phase B — Precision Modelling remains active.**

Completed precision slices:
- Add Vertex cross-object snapping (.324)
- component Move cross-object snapping (.325)
- live component Move ΔX/ΔY/ΔZ readback (.326)
- Repeat UI duplication corrected (.328)
- component Align X/Y/Z (.329)
- explicit pick-anchor Align workflow (.330)
- Circle regularize for simple closed Vertex/Edge loops (.331)
- Circle visibility/cache fix (.332)
- exactly one selected Face can Circle its boundary (.333)
- Circle moved from Selection into contextual Active Tools (.334)
- Face Split restored under canonical additive Multi (.335)
- Circle exact per-mode Active Tools layout (.336)
- existing Rotate Edge audited as Edge Flip and consolidated under the Flip Edge label (.337)

Recommended next build:
- **Grid Fill** for a conservative structured closed-boundary fill workflow, after the mandatory existing-feature audit
- existing **Fill** already functions as a single-face Cap for one selected closed edge loop, so do not duplicate Cap

Other Phase B priorities remain:
- stronger structured Fill / Grid Fill / Cap workflows
- support-loop construction improvements

Do not reopen Phase A unless a concrete cleanup regression is reported.

## End-of-session requirement

Before finishing any future code-changing BoxLab session:
- rewrite this handoff to the resulting repo state
- append the milestone to `DEV_HISTORY.md`
- update `TEST_CHECKLIST.md` for newly stable behavior
- verify a brand-new chat could continue using only the repo and these files
