# BoxLab — AI Development Handoff

## Read this first

This is the living current-state handoff for BoxLab.

Before changing code:
1. read `AI_WORKFLOW.md`
2. read this file completely
3. read `TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
4. read the newest relevant entries in `DEV_HISTORY.md`
5. inspect current `main`

The repository is authoritative. If anything here conflicts with current `main`, reconcile this file before coding.

Phase A remains frozen at v0.36.18.323. Phase B — Precision Modelling — is active.

## Latest completed development — v0.36.18.328

Theme: **remove duplicate Precision Face / Repeat Previous UI**.

Root cause:
- `drawer-ui.js` already dynamically loaded `precision-face.js` and `repeat-face-previous.js`
- v0.36.18.327 also added direct module loads in `index.html`
- both modules executed twice, creating duplicate UI/handlers

Fix:
- removed direct `index.html` loads
- retained `drawer-ui.js` as the single authoritative loader
- updated its dynamic import pins to the current .327 implementations
- added a regression contract that asserts one loader path only

Important:
- the feature itself was not rewritten
- Repeat Previous exact-value behavior is preserved
- Through exclusion remains preserved
- future work must audit existing/dynamic loaders before adding module tags

## Current Clean for SubD pipeline

1. **Four-triangle center-fan repair**
   - conservative local repair
   - guarded manifold/crease/normal/fold/aspect checks

2. **Sliver cleanup**
   - conservative short smooth interior triangle-edge collapse
   - only commits demonstrably safe improvements

3. **Bounded even triangle-island complete matching**
   - connected triangle-only components
   - bounded up to **40 triangles**
   - complete matching required
   - no stranded triangles
   - surrounding quad-flow scoring
   - aggregate patch-quality guard
   - worst-boundary mismatch guard
   - **.319 internal proposed-quad flow-coherence scoring**
   - **.320 smooth-interior valence-aware completed-patch ranking**
   - **.321 worst-local valence-aware completed-patch ranking**
   - **.322 worst-local internal-flow-aware completed-patch ranking**
   - **.323 per-stage topology audit + transactional core rollback**
   - no vertex movement
   - no surrounding-quad rewrite
   - rejected patches remain untouched

4. **Residual safe triangle-pair merge**
   - same surrounding-flow and quality context
   - conservative non-overlapping merge

5. **Guarded all-quad tangent relaxation**
   - safe interior vertices only
   - boundary/crease/non-quad protections
   - commits only when flow improves

The user-facing wrapper validates topology and rolls back invalid results transactionally.

## Important recent selection fix — v0.36.18.314

A regression caused Face multi-select not to work immediately after startup; switching away from Face mode and back made it work.

The fix is `src/component-multi-init.js?v=0.36.18.314`.

It initializes intended additive component multi-selection for Face/Edge/Vertex and restores that state after relevant mode/tool handoffs.

**Protect this behavior.** Fresh-load Face multi-select must work without requiring a mode cycle first.

## Protected interaction baseline

Preserve unless the user explicitly requests otherwise:

- one-finger orbit
- two-finger pan
- pinch zoom
- two-finger tap Undo
- three-finger tap Redo
- no-jump orbit pivot
- persistent selections during navigation
- Studio realtime default/behaviour
- object-management / Multi workflow
- existing snapping
- Knife
- Loop Cut
- Edge Bevel
- Vertex Bevel
- ordinary Extrude
- connected multi-face Extrude
- Inset
- Through, including cavity-aware Through
- Extract
- Bridge
- Join
- Boolean workflows
- Base/SubD export workflows

## Protected files / pins

- **Never casually edit:** `src/multi-object-transform.js?v=0.36.1.0`
- Expected protected blob SHA: `0b6f676900bf9a3787cf420e276bbb0f57ac46ff`
- **Do not casually update:** `styles.css?v=0.36.18.270`
- Preserve `component-multi-init.js?v=0.36.18.314` unless intentionally changing component-selection startup.
- Mature Through behavior is topology-sensitive and regression-prone.
- Clean for SubD must remain transactional.
- No service worker.
- Avoid broad MutationObservers when a narrow module/event hook is possible.
- Old-looking cache pins may be intentional.

## Known watchouts

- The README is older than the live application; do not use it as the authoritative feature/version source.
- Many module cache pins are deliberately old/frozen.
- Clean for SubD is intentionally conservative; “no safe repairs found” can be correct.
- Preserve history/object-manager/selection synchronization around topology commits.
- Failed topology operations must restore the pre-operation mesh.
- Distinguish release commits from later cache-hop, Pages-marker, or handoff-documentation commits.
- Do not infer a new release number just because current `main` has commits after the canonical release commit.

## Next development step

**Phase B — Precision Modelling remains active.**

Before any next feature work, follow the mandatory existing-feature audit in `AI_WORKFLOW.md`, including dynamic imports such as `drawer-ui.js`.

Completed precision slices:
- Add Vertex cross-object snapping (.324)
- component Move cross-object snapping (.325)
- live component Move ΔX/ΔY/ΔZ readback (.326)
- Repeat Previous for Face Extrude/Inset (.327)
- duplicate Repeat Previous UI loader removed (.328)

Recommended next build:
- **Align / Flatten component tools**, but first search the current source/UI/dynamic imports for any existing Align/Flatten implementation or equivalent

Other Phase B priorities remain:
- Circle / regularize selected components
- Edge Flip
- stronger structured Fill / Grid Fill / Cap workflows
- support-loop construction improvements

Do not reopen Phase A unless a concrete cleanup regression is reported.

## End-of-session requirement

Before finishing any future code-changing BoxLab session:
- rewrite this handoff to the resulting repo state
- append the milestone to `DEV_HISTORY.md`
- update `TEST_CHECKLIST.md` for newly stable behavior
- verify a brand-new chat could continue using only the repo and these files
