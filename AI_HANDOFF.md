# BoxLab — AI Development Handoff

## Read this first

This is the living current-state handoff for BoxLab.

Before changing code:
1. read `AI_WORKFLOW.md`
2. read this file completely
3. read `TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
4. read the newest relevant entries in `DEV_HISTORY.md`
5. inspect current `main`

The repository is authoritative. If anything here conflicts with current `main`, reconcile this file before coding.

## Latest completed development — v0.36.18.329

Theme: **component Align X / Y / Z after existing-feature audit**.

Audit result:
- Face **Make Planar** already existed and already handles arbitrary-plane flattening of one selected Face
- therefore no second generic “Flatten Face” tool was added

New capability:
- Align X
- Align Y
- Align Z

The new Align utility works on Vertex / Edge / Face selections by gathering the unique vertices belonging to the selected components and setting the chosen axis coordinate to the average selected coordinate.

Behavior:
1. works in Vertex / Edge / Face modes
2. hidden in Object mode
3. preserves current component selection
4. commits as one Undo history step
5. does not alter unrelated coordinates
6. does not replace or duplicate Make Planar

Implementation:
- `src/component-align-core.js`
- `src/component-align.js`
- loaded once through `drawer-ui.js`

Protected `src/multi-object-transform.js?v=0.36.1.0` remains untouched.

## Current Clean for SubD pipeline

1. **Four-triangle center-fan repair**
   - conservative local repair
   - guarded manifold/crease/normal/fold/aspect checks

2. **Sliver cleanup**
   - conservative short smooth interior triangle-edge collapse
   - only commits demonstrably safe improvements

3. **Bounded even triangle-island complete matching**
   - connected triangle-only components
   - bounded up to **40 triangles**
   - complete matching required
   - no stranded triangles
   - surrounding quad-flow scoring
   - aggregate patch-quality guard
   - worst-boundary mismatch guard
   - **.319 internal proposed-quad flow-coherence scoring**
   - **.320 smooth-interior valence-aware completed-patch ranking**
   - **.321 worst-local valence-aware completed-patch ranking**
   - **.322 worst-local internal-flow-aware completed-patch ranking**
   - **.323 per-stage topology audit + transactional core rollback**
   - no vertex movement
   - no surrounding-quad rewrite
   - rejected patches remain untouched

4. **Residual safe triangle-pair merge**
   - same surrounding-flow and quality context
   - conservative non-overlapping merge

5. **Guarded all-quad tangent relaxation**
   - safe interior vertices only
   - boundary/crease/non-quad protections
   - commits only when flow improves

The user-facing wrapper validates topology and rolls back invalid results transactionally.

## Important recent selection fix — v0.36.18.314

A regression caused Face multi-select not to work immediately after startup; switching away from Face mode and back made it work.

The fix is `src/component-multi-init.js?v=0.36.18.314`.

It initializes intended additive component multi-selection for Face/Edge/Vertex and restores that state after relevant mode/tool handoffs.

**Protect this behavior.** Fresh-load Face multi-select must work without requiring a mode cycle first.

## Protected interaction baseline

Preserve unless the user explicitly requests otherwise:

- one-finger orbit
- two-finger pan
- pinch zoom
- two-finger tap Undo
- three-finger tap Redo
- no-jump orbit pivot
- persistent selections during navigation
- Studio realtime default/behaviour
- object-management / Multi workflow
- existing snapping
- Knife
- Loop Cut
- Edge Bevel
- Vertex Bevel
- ordinary Extrude
- connected multi-face Extrude
- Inset
- Through, including cavity-aware Through
- Extract
- Bridge
- Join
- Boolean workflows
- Base/SubD export workflows

## Protected files / pins

- **Never casually edit:** `src/multi-object-transform.js?v=0.36.1.0`
- Expected protected blob SHA: `0b6f676900bf9a3787cf420e276bbb0f57ac46ff`
- **Do not casually update:** `styles.css?v=0.36.18.270`
- Preserve `component-multi-init.js?v=0.36.18.314` unless intentionally changing component-selection startup.
- Mature Through behavior is topology-sensitive and regression-prone.
- Clean for SubD must remain transactional.
- No service worker.
- Avoid broad MutationObservers when a narrow module/event hook is possible.
- Old-looking cache pins may be intentional.

- SubD OBJ export

## Known watchouts

- The README is older than the live application; do not use it as the authoritative feature/version source.
- Many module cache pins are deliberately old/frozen.
- Clean for SubD is intentionally conservative; “no safe repairs found” can be correct.
- Preserve history/object-manager/selection synchronization around topology commits.
- Failed topology operations must restore the pre-operation mesh.
- Distinguish release commits from later cache-hop, Pages-marker, or handoff-documentation commits.
- Do not infer a new release number just because current `main` has commits after the canonical release commit.

## Next development step

**Phase B — Precision Modelling remains active.**

Completed precision slices:
- Add Vertex cross-object snapping (.324)
- component Move cross-object snapping (.325)
- live component Move ΔX/ΔY/ΔZ readback (.326)
- Repeat UI duplication corrected (.328)
- component Align X/Y/Z (.329), while retaining existing Make Planar

Recommended next build:
- **Circle / regularize selected components**, but perform the mandatory existing-feature audit first for circle / regularize / relax / spacing equivalents

Other Phase B priorities remain:
- Edge Flip
- stronger structured Fill / Grid Fill / Cap workflows
- support-loop construction improvements

Do not reopen Phase A unless a concrete cleanup regression is reported.

## End-of-session requirement

Before finishing any future code-changing BoxLab session:
- rewrite this handoff to the resulting repo state
- append the milestone to `DEV_HISTORY.md`
- update `TEST_CHECKLIST.md` for newly stable behavior
- verify a brand-new chat could continue using only the repo and these files
