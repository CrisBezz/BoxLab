## .1032 — VIEW startup repair and seven-object retest — 31 October 2026

User .1031 FAIL: “7 Objects did not load” and VIEW modes “seem to have been
removed. BIG FAIL”. Stop feature rollout; .1030 remains the last accepted build.
Baseline main0c18e678/runtime80e2d61d. The .1031 sample ACTUALLY contains ONE cube
with seven maps, not seven objects. No importer object-loss reproduction found;
replace unclear retest with an explicit seven-object fixture instead of pretending
the original file contained seven. Keep .1031 failed/pending device gate visible.

VIEW source/buttons were not intentionally removed. Cloud browser on live1031
shows all12 look controls, but cloud WebGL is disabled, so this does NOT refute
native feedback or prove GPU operation. Concrete owner flaw reproduced: installUI
uses host.innerHTML, deleting Cavity/Silhouette if their independent owners run
first; dataset.ready also prevents restoring an emptied host. Two new real-owner
DOM tests FAIL against1031 source and PASS after repair. Exact iPad whole-menu
failure cause remains unproven; no speculative CSS/compositor or cache diagnosis.

Original render-modes installer now adds only missing base buttons from its same
10-button template, preserving existing Cavity/Silhouette nodes/listeners. Per-host
delegation binds ONCE. Native VIEW open re-runs this idempotent installer, restoring
missing/cleared base controls without polling, new render engine or geometry changes.
Original Facegroup controls and actual setMode actions retained. No shader/light/
material/selection/history/input/CSS/frozen/main/Multi implementation changes.

Native raw-image inspection adapter moved OUT of shared uv-image-preview into
workspace-only nomad-uv-image-choices. Shared image controller receives its resolver
as an option; GLB/3D paths retain original resolver and decoder. This removes the
inspection dependency from the render-mode graph; NOT a claim that it caused the
reported failure. Existing1031 seven-slot/byte/16-bit/cancel/UV read-only tests stay
active through the original workspace adapter. No duplicate decoder or image pool.

New docs/samples/NOM_SEVEN_OBJECTS_1032.nom: SEVEN independent cubes in two rows,
named01 Colour,02 Normal,03 Emissive,04 Roughness,05 Metalness,06 Opacity,
07 Displacement. Each contains ONE exact raw map reference for UV Image inspection.
Non-colour cubes may have ordinary solid 3D shading; this is a loading/inspection
fixture, not a claim of no-colour-map PBR or displacement rendering support.
Actual File dispatcher->fit->manager adds all7; checked sample matches generator.
Existing1031 one-cube fixture remains reproducible; do not overwrite it silently.

85 focused PASS/0FAIL/0skip, including4 new regressions, actual imported7 and
workspace/VIEW/native/GLB/release protection. Reviewed reverse-loader pins1032 and
canonical recovery chain; other runtime JS edits are pins only. Full local Node24.22.1:3055 PASS/0FAIL/0skip/0cancel (107.16s). No runtime/test edits after full-suite start. Publication proof follows; native .1032 acceptance is not inferred.
In-app test list explicitly distinguishes seven OBJECTS from seven MAPS.
DEVICE1032 first openVIEW before import: all12 looks including Cavity/Silhouette;
Studio->Solid->Studio and close/reopen. Import new sample: seven named cubes;
select a cube,Object radialUV->UV Editor->Image to see its ONE map,BackTo3D/Close,
recheckVIEW. Orbit/UndoRedo and accepted1030 transform sample sanity.
Next ONLY device repair feedback; defer new native material/performance features.
