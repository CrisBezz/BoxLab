# .934 — Dedicated Blur Amount


## .934 — Blur Amount; .933 user PASS — 21 October 2026 (Brisbane)

User933PASS protects image wrapping across cube edges/UV seams, Move/Rotate/Scale,
Apply/history/SaveOpen. Audit main6688de17/live933: original paint-core has fixed
centre4/cardinal1 one-pass blur, no stronger filter/slider owner. Extend original
raster only; no new brush, adjacency, input, history, resource or writer implementation.

Blur shows Amount1–32, default8. Amount repeats existing smoothing kernel over the
stroke-start snapshot; Opacity mixes filtered target with original; Size controls brush
footprint. Core filter.amount defaults1 (legacy calls/settings remain valid). Main
UI passes optional blurAmount; shared brush defaults/Lab saved settings/native schemas
unchanged. Existing original neighbour table handles connected faces/UV seams on every
pass; no atlas-neighbour reads or new topology plan. Writes still clip to picked face:
stroke both sides. One-pass exact accepted .931/.932 outputs retained; strong blur
uses premultiplied RGBA through all passes (raw masks/scalars remain independent).

Compute target once/contact, using two bounded Float64 RGBA buffers to avoid rounding
between passes; one target retained for contact. At512² each buffer8MiB,16MiB filtering
buffers total; target8MiB retained plus existing before/coverage/domain/pool resources.
Uniform sources shortcut; opacity0 skips filtering. Max32*512² texel visits, no
per-dab repeated filtering or unbounded feedback. Coverage remains max/contact;
lift/repeat for more. Finish/cancel/dispose drops target; validation precedes contact
state publication. Amount input cancels in-flight work and updates existing readout;
original Paint history reopen retains tool/amount. Current selected layer/channel only.
Image colour stays source-preserved/read-only pending explicit image conversion.

Five new regressions: analytical one/two/32-pass impulse and independent opacity;
alpha/raw scalar/domain/invalid/no-op/cancel; strong folded-seam sampling excludes
atlas decoy and far-face writes; actual UI low/high softness, amount-change rollback,
Paint UndoRedo and SaveOpen/exact native PNG; scalar/mask isolation/checkpoint refusal.
Focused26PASS incl .933 wrapping6 and Paint-history5; release5PASS; full below.
No old assertions relaxed. Complete changed raster/Lab/main reverse loader graph934;
accepted933 wrap/graph/export/UV inspector, main/cage/Multi/frozen bytes unchanged.
Device934 strength/first-contact latency pending; Node timings are not iPad evidence.
Read docs/paint-blur-amount-934.md. Reflection preview independently unresolved.
Next image-to-paint conversion/blur, then Merge Down/Flatten, staged resolutions/layer
budgets; Smudge/AO/edge-seam authoring queued. Current512²/1024²/256²/base+3 unchanged.

The Amount number is a smoothing-pass count, not pixels, world radius or percent.
At1 the old five-tap effect is retained. Repeated passes broaden diffusion; raising
Opacity alone cannot enlarge the filter. At32 there is more CPU work at contact start,
then all dabs reuse the same target. A development Node24 measurement on512² with a
complete neighbour table was24/55/178ms for1/8/32; this is diagnostic only and not an
M2/Safari timing promise. Device acceptance remains required. No new async owner,
render context, file field or resampling engine. Colour space remains accepted sRGB
byte-space; alpha filtering/interpolation is premultiplied. Stroke target is transient
and never included in global history/project/export resources.
