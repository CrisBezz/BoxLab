## .1030 — native NOM texture translation and rotation — 30 October 2026

User explicitly reports .1029 PASS and /nextbuild. Protect colour-image alpha,
combined separate opacity/scalars, solid OFF control, source retention and all
accepted .1025–.1028 PBR/round-trip/lighting behaviours. Baseline main/runtime
6dff6e5a415b09b065b19f6e8285bac7d9ce684d. Current numbered release .1030.

Audit found native texture transforms already retained but viewport deliberately
refused nonzero offsets/rotation. Existing nomad-material-resource plan and
uv-image-surface-preview remain authoritative. Verified convention against
stephomi/nomad-link commit08391c8e00f274913c673e2459ed5a2e059a0ac0,
blender/nomad_blender_link/__init__.py set_mapping_transform: radians, native
UV origin at top left, scale THEN rotation THEN offset about UV zero. Conjugating
its Blender mapping by V -> 1-V gives native matrix rows:
[cos(r)*sx, sin(r)*sy, offsetX]; [-sin(r)*sx, cos(r)*sy, offsetY]; [0,0,1].
Three automatic texture transforms have a different order under nonuniform scale;
use its original per-texture matrix with matrixAutoUpdate=false, not baked UV edits.
Each colour/normal/roughness/metalness/emissive/opacity map has its own transform.
UV Image/always-unlit stay colour-only, now with supported colour transforms.
Malformed/nonfinite or Float32-overflow scale/offset remains retained-only; invalid
auxiliary skips only that map. Auto/UV projection, budgets, exact source bytes,
original picking/geometry/history, serial decode/cancel/disposal, transparency and
Studio shadow owners unchanged. No new renderer, UV/modelling kernel or UI reskin.
Triplanar/displacement/refraction/additive/dithering remain separately unsupported.

Four new actual-owner/real-Three tests check independent Blender-conjugate golden
UV positions, both rotation signs, signed/nonuniform scale, every map matrix and
colour space/alpha, unchanged UVs/source, malformed input and late cancellation,
UV Image/unlit and byte-identical pooled/inline SaveOpen and native NOM parse/export.
Older .1025–.1028 nonzero-transform refusal fixtures now use nonfinite transforms;
the same refusal assertions stay active and new tests cover the expanded capability.
41 focused checks PASS/0FAIL/0skip including release/cache/identity protection.
Full local Node24.22.1 suite: 3046 PASS/0FAIL/0skip/0cancel (214.23s). Final canonical parent-loader/cache checks rerun: 11 PASS after a pin-only correction to drawer -> face-layout -> release-version. No functional runtime/test changes after full-suite start. Publication verified: see docs/publication-1030.md; no GPU/iPad PASS claimed.

Generic docs/samples/NOM_TEXTURE_TRANSFORM_1030.nom (76,188 bytes): cyan arrow on
four coloured quadrants. Left original, middle offset[.25,.125], right scale[2,1]
then pi/2 rotation with offset[0,2]. Same source image; compare SAME file in Nomad.
In-app test list updated; earlier .1029 ratings retained; no new A/B batch.
Reviewed reverse loader graph and canonical release/recovery pins .1030; other
runtime JS changes are import pins only. Main/Multi1.0/frozen betas untouched.

DEVICE1030: import sample in Studio/Solid, compare original/shifted/sideways repeated
arrow with Nomad; orbit/select/Move/UndoRedo; switch looks, SaveOpen.boxlab and
NOMAD/Nomad comparison. Accepted .1029 colour-alpha sample should stay unchanged.
Next: native transform feedback, then audit remaining sampler/projection gaps;
displacement/subdivision needs its separate bounded performance/benchmark decision.

The independent test oracle uses the published Blender POINT mapping and flips V
on both sides, instead of reproducing the production matrix calculation. Native
GPU appearance still requires the user's BoxLab/Nomad comparison.
