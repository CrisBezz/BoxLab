## .1029 — native NOM colour-image alpha — 30 October 2026

User corrects initial1028 FAIL: “1028 PASS - refresh took some time but it worked
eventually :) /nextbuild”. This supersedes the initial report; protect accepted
1028 grayscale opacity/blending/backface/shadow handling plus1027 emission and
1026/1025 PBR/retention. Refresh lag is an observation, not evidence of opacity
failure; verify new shell/manifest/pins/live bytes, no speculative refresh changes.
Baseline main797f3538 / runtime d781f169.

Audit: native material already retains use_color_opacity. Extend existing resource
plan and UV overlay only: explicit true/1 opts into colour-image alpha in lit native
Studio/Solid. false/0/absent stays solid unless existing opacity map/scalar applies.
Unknown flags retain prior opaque inspection/refusal; no truthiness coercion.
Three's ORIGINAL RGBA map shader now runs for opted-in surfaces, multiplying image
alpha with existing linear alphaMap and factorOpacity * blending material opacity.
Accepted1028 RGB-only shader stays for colour-alpha OFF when opacity is otherwise
active. Native lit colour requests existing unpremultiplied bitmap path even when
alpha OFF so nonzero RGB under zero alpha survives; no pixel rewrite/re-encode.
Existing serial cancellation, preview budgets, source bytes, normal/scalar/emission,
selection/picking/history, shadow/backface lifetime and both Studio owners retained.
Unlit/UV Image retain prior colour-only policy; refraction/additive/dithering/native
vertex opacity remain unsupported. Transparency sorting limitations unchanged.
No geometry/subdivision/extra renderer/light or global material change.

Four new real-owner/Three/actual RGBA PNG checks cover explicit flag semantics,
RGBA vs RGB-only shader routing, combined independent map/scalar factors, solid OFF
control, raw zero/full alpha+nonzero RGB and unpremultiplied decoder/cancellation,
unlit/UV Image and exact pooled SaveOpen/native NOM bytes.1028 test now accepts
explicit flag1 per new feature and still rejects invalid2; all previous map/shadow/
cleanup assertions retained.35 focused PASS/0FAIL/0skip. Full final local Node24.22.1 suite3042 PASS/
0FAIL/0skip/0cancel (222.31s); no runtime/test edits after full-suite start.
Syntax/diff clean. No native GPU/iPad visual acceptance inferred.
Reviewed reverse-loader cache closure; most changes import pins only. Protected
main/Multi1.0/frozen betas, decoder and both1028 Studio shadow owners unchanged.
In-app list includes1029 checks; prior1028 ratings retained; no A/B batch required.

Generic docs/samples/NOM_COLOUR_ALPHA_1029.nom: left alpha ON checker holes; middle
same image x separate2x opacity map x uniform65% (factorOpacity .8); right same image
alpha OFF, solid. Fixture is test-only RGBA PNG construction plus original native
writer; original production opaque PNG encoders untouched. No user artwork.
DEVICE1029 Studio/Solid orbit: left checker holes,middle combined transparency,
right solid cyan; select/Move/UndoRedo,looks/back,SaveOpen.boxlab,NOMAD/Nomad.
Accepted1028 and1027 samples unchanged. Native GPU/iPad1029 acceptance pending.
Next native colour-alpha feedback, then audit native texture translation/rotation
sampling through same owner; displacement/subdivision remains separately deferred.
